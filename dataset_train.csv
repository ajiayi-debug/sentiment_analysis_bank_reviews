0,5,Face ID and OTP issues : The OTP to create a new billing payee was sent to my email account? Why the sudden change? Furthermore when I get out of the app to retrieve the OTP and get back to the app by switching (I did not turn off the app) the whole app reset and I had to recreate from the beginning when I switched back the “window” on my iOS. Does that mean I now need more than one device to create a new billing organisation payee? Why the huge inconvenience? If I’m outside and have only my phone how can I create a billing organisation payee easily? The Face ID issue was only resolved after I reset the app and had to change my settings back to enable Face ID. Most likely this issue occurred when the app was updated but this is the first time. Not sure what has happened to the quality control and processes that were in place before. Things are not as clear as before.,0,
1,5,"Easy to use & simple to understand : I find that the POSB digibank app is very easy to use and that everything is pretty simple for us users & consumers to understand. Only problem that I feel needs improvement is the duration of how long y'all take to maintain the app, as we users sometimes are promised a fixed timing whereby we can resume using the app, but when we are on the main page of the app, it indicates that the maintenance still isn't over and that causes a lot of problems as we cannot complete, let's say an important transaction that is really urgent and needs to be done as soon as possible. Other than that, I don't think there's any other issues regarding the app. As a whole, a great app and a very useful platform for users & consumers.",0,
2,5,"The best digital banking app in Singapore! : I absolutely love the POSB Digibank app! It has made managing my finances so much easier and convenient. The user interface is clean and intuitive, and I can easily view my account balances and transaction history. The app also has a lot of useful features, such as the ability to transfer money to other accounts and pay bills. I particularly like the fact that I can set up custom notifications to stay on top of my spending. Overall, I highly recommend the POSB Digibank app to anyone who wants a simple and effective way to manage their money.",0,
3,4,"Accessing digital token when logged in. : Well introducing digital token is a great move and I like the fact I can use it without entering otp and that it is a seamless way to make payments. There is one caveat tho - The way the app allows you to access the digital token. Well u can access the token via the splash screen when u on the app. Great! But upon login, the digital token is not accessible or not that I know of after using this feature for almost a year. I find myself in a situation where I have to log out or force close the app and reopening it to access the digital token.  
Sometimes I need to make sure I have funds before I want to make payment but I can’t get the app to either automatically respond to the payment I’m trying to make and there is no way to access digital token when login inside. Hopefully something can be made to resolve this.",0,
4,4,"Payment Controls Monthly Spend Tracking : Under Payment Controls > Monthly Spend Limit, there is a Current Spend tracking. However, as I was told by CSO that this Current Spend follows a monthly cycle that starts on the day that Monthly Spend Limit is toggled on. Let’s say I toggled on the Limit on 13 Feb, this will trigger the Current Spend to start tracking spending from 13 Feb - 12 Mar. Over time I tend not to remember this cycle (when it starts and ends) and the entire spend tracking is rendered meaningless. Wonder if change Limit midway, will it also change the tracking cycle? Hope to see a spend tracking based on calendar month controlled by monthly spend limit.",0,
5,5,"Best bank app in Sg : POSB digibank app is the best banking app in Singapore I’ve used. I have all 3 major bank apps and a few other banks app. Digibank is fast, clear and easy to use. Unlike other banking apps, there is no lag when moving from 1 screen to another 👍🏼
I wish the bank can lead other banks in savings & fixed deposits rates too 😅 There are areas the bank can do better which I will not mention here as it’s not directly related to the app.",0,
6,1,"Bank app causes phone to get very hot within 1min of use : When I start up the app on my new iPhone 12 which I got in Jan 2021, it causes the phone to get very hot within 1 min. The problem became worse when I upgraded to iOS 14.4. After using the bank app, my phone functions will fail (eg I can’t open apps, can’t download mails, can’t sync to iCloud). Upgrading to iOS 14.4.1 did not help either. I have to restart my phone every time these issues occur. The issue recurs again when I use the bank app. It is unsustainable to keep restarting the phone every time I use the bank app. Given how essential a bank app is (now that the app acts as the digital token and physical tokens are phased out by the bank), I hope that both Apple’s and DBS’ teams can work together to resolve this issue.",0,
7,1,"Violates App Store policies : This DBS/POSB banking app blatantly misuses push notification access for the purpose of advertising. App Store policy: 

4.5.4 Push Notifications must not be required for the app to function, and should not be used to send sensitive personal or confidential information. Push Notifications should not be used for promotions or direct marketing purposes unless customers have explicitly opted in to receive them via consent language displayed in your app’s UI, and you provide a method in your app for a user to opt out from receiving such messages. Abuse of these services may result in revocation of your privileges.

This is a word-for-word popup from the app: With app (push) notifications, never miss: 

1. Offers you wish you knew sooner 

2. Protips to spend wisely 

3. Smart insights meant for you. On a banking app, I would definitely want push notifications for security purposes, such as transactions and login or Digital 2FA token notifications. 

However, I can only either accept the marketing spam (promos etc) or not have these important notifications at all.",0,
8,3,"Connection : I’m unable to login when I’m on mobile data, even after clearing of cache, or restart of the iPhone. When attempting to login, it will cause data cut to the other apps too; unless I kill all the apps and switching on/off the airplane mode to re-established a connection with the mobile service. 

Sometimes, almost never, i can log in, but! as i tap on any of my account, it will throw an error message saying “your system encountered a momentary Technical difficulty...” the same error as logging in or any of the area in the app. 

It will only work fine, on wireless connection. Of course, I’m in an open area, full coverage of 4G, and even tried using it during midday afternoon or super late in the midnight. Same result even no peak hour traffic. So i still think its the app. Because i can do every mobile data related to every other app but yours. 

I hope the development team can take a look into this, because its causing a lot of inconveniences.",0,
9,2,"Fix the terrible performance : Every single update says “performance improvements” but every single time I open the app, my phone gets hot and the battery starts going down about 1% per minute. Are POSB mining Bitcoin on our phones?

Because of this, I use the app as little as possible. But giving more than 1 star since it’s still better than UOB’s app.

It would be more usable if we could give nicknames to bill payments, I have 2 accounts with M1 but POSB only lets me identify them by the 9 digit account number so I need to try to remember which is which every time I need to make a manual payment.",0,
10,5,"Posb digibank app lately- not stable : Of late the posb digibank is not stable. It hanged and took a very long time to open. This started last wk and today as well. I had to delete app and reinstalled to get it working.  After reinstalling, it worked for awhile and then the same problem happens again like today. This is so disappointing and I wonder what happened. Please check, thank you",0,
11,1,App affects mobile connection : An app that affects phone mobile connection when used. Mobile connection will stop working when app is used. It will start to connect when app is started and after a while the app will stop responding saying there is an issue with internet connection. Only then user will find the rest of the apps will also stop working as there is no internet connection from the phone.  Workaround is to enable airplane mode and disable it again to bring back the connection. A simple transaction will sometimes require a few of such actions before it can be completed. Really lousy experience.,0,
12,4,"Love this app and if u don’t have it, get it now!! : Best banking app ever, so easy to use once you learn to navigate.
Quick so I can transfer money smoothly without any issues. Honestly a fantastic app and now it’s come with more enhanced features which make me more knowledgeable about my spending and earnings habits. 
Thank you the great app which makes life easier especially with banking. 
Financial health is important to look after to and this app makes it easy with detailed functions and also gives me an overview of everything.",0,
13,4,"Good app, best in the market in terms of functionality. But one basic feature lacking : This is by far the best banking app on the market. The ability to view all my assets and liabilities in one place is very useful. 

Suffice to say, I’ve started investing in DBS’ funds offerings just to keep everything in one place and easily tracked. 

One major gripe I have with DBS, is that the cards spend is not immediately reflected in card’s balance. If you refer to other banking apps, 1 -2 days after making a purchase on the credit card, immediately you’ll find the outstanding balance (not to be confused with statement balance) on the app. Which makes for easy tracking. 

This is the main reason why I’ve used UOB or Amex rather than DBS credit cards. I can’t track my monthly expenditure on a go with ease. 

Perhaps the team should really look into unlocking this feature.",0,
14,4,"To view multiple Accounts : I used to see all my deposit accounts, credit cards accounts in one page but not anymore. Every time I finished doing one transaction & I have to go to the home page, click the down arrow to list all the accounts & view a specify account & back to home page & repeat this step all over again, is not user friendly for this part, overall experience in other transaction via this app are very fast & simple to use.",0,
15,3,Issues with adding apple pay on apple watch : I encountered issues with adding my POSB debit card for apple pay on apple watch. My other back debit card was successfully set up though and I only have 2 cards to add. The messages either show: 1 - Could not add card/Card not added. Contact your card issuer for more information; OR 2 - Apple Pay is unavailable. Try again later. I did reset both my iPhone and apple watch then logged in again but still have the same issues.,0,

17,2,"Buggy app, a shadow of its former self. : I used to love this app, really enjoyed how seamless banking became with it. However, it appears as though this app is on a decline. 
1. Enable FaceID but it does not work! I still need to enter my PIN to log in. 
2. After entering my PIN, I receive an error message “This service isn’t available now...” and I’ll need to restart the app multiple times before I’m able to log in. 
3. Repeatedly asks me to set up my digital token even though I did it ages ago. 
4. Where is the Comment box for transfers? It is useful as I can inform the other party what the transfer is for.
5. Sometimes, I’m only able to make a transfer once. Attempting a 2nd transfer will result in the above mentioned error message.

This app used to make my banking a breeze, these days I get frustrated while using it. I’ve tried contacting POSB via their website to leave a feedback but I’m unable to find an avenue to do so.",0,
18,1,"Service Not Available poping up : When trying to login, keep poping up Service Not Available. This service issue turned paynow and cashless payment into a hell of a problem. Can’t login meaning all transaction cannot be done. I have to relied on carrying lots of cash again.

This is a no brainer. I ended up setting up my budget first on a spreadsheet  then copying the values to the app.",0,
20,5,"Efficient and hassle free apps : This app gets all the major tasks that we need for our day to day business with banking done quite efficiently. There is no lag and no crash for me this far.

This is so tiring come on you want to be the biggest bank in SEA but the app you make works terrible, probably the most annoying app on my phone right now.

22,1,"World Class Digital Banking Experience? : The statement “deliver world class banking experience” is laughable.

1007,2,"Biometric login | Quick peek gone aft update? : Have always lauded TouchID login as a key game changer to friends as it really speeds up the process and makes PayNow / Scan to Pay a breeze (rest of waiting time mostly on sending and receiving of transaction status).

It was mysteriously gone after an app update. After having read the reviews, realised FaceID is not supported as well.
Please make biometric login a priority as this is key to a good / secure mobile banking app.

*balance Quick peek unfortunately has also been missing after my last update.*

If implementing Face ID in a future update, perhaps would be a good time to do a ‘iOS12’ styled version as well. To fine tune critical features and fix bugs in existing ones.

A future feature request would be to be able to streamline e interface further and allow user to customise e home screen to hide lesser used functions and bring most common ones forward.

OCBC’s interface is nice to look at, but TouchID login process is limited and app crashes time to time upon conducting transactions.

Hope POSB’s versions moves forward at a steady and measured pace. To add stuff and improve w each iteration w/o breaking any existing features*",0,
1008,4,"POSB digibank : Well. After the latest update, things really do seem smoother. 
However when making payments to other bank's credit card, it becomes tricky. Because the banks logos do not appear. Instead, a large yellow dot with the letter L in the center appears as the logo. And all the other credit cards will have that same logo. So stupid!
So every time I make a credit card payment to say UOB, I have to remember my credit card number. Because there's this yellow logo, and all the other credit cards have the same yellow logo with the letter L. Surely DBS can do better. 
Thank you.",0,
1009,4,"lagging behind other banks : Other banks provide better login methods (faster and uses good FaceID). POSB/DBS need to catch up. Heard a new app is coming, hope key functions such as amount used on credit card will be there (instead of having to manually available limit minus from the total limit to calculate it. You should also always display pending transactions (citibank and UOB are already doing it - don’t understand why the “best” bank in singapore doesn’t have any of these functions.

Regarding this issue, when I close the app using the home button and return back to the app via home screen or multi task window, there's no verification with Touch ID again, that's a security compromise. It would be better if there's always a request for Touch ID. When popping in and out of the app.",0,

When I saw the digits literally not moving after I spent some money, I went to the ATM machine to check and my balance was really different from what I saw on the app. Yes it was a surprise for me to realize the digits I've been seeing is not updated at all for quite some time. Please help fix this issue. I love using this app cuz it's v useful and user-friendly. I would like to give it 5 stars again.",0,
1014,1,"Slow : Before the update , everything was so smooth and neat , it’s basically zero effort be it transaction wise as well as checking of balance and all 
However after the update , checking of balance was slow and all , everything requires SMS Pin and all , it really slowed down the whole process by a lot as it was once easily done with fingerprint scanning 

Besides the whole SMS pin problem , sometimes it showed incorrect pin even though it was the right one , and i had to leave the app first , then enter back the app to be able to access to the page that i want

You see , maybe instead of trying to improve useless stuffs , what not just bring back the old one which was smooth and fast , I feel that for us users , nothing beats quick and efficiency , we just need our stuffs quick , and not a slow process like this 

It’s really quite disappointing as i once liked the app a lot and introduced it to a lot of my friends",0,
1015,1,"History for overseas transfer : Have u just updated again the app without proper notifications for us to update in iTunes?

Previously when I do transfer I could check it out in the history, in which I have another box there to select the transaction type which is for overseas transfer. Now I could only see the account type and the latter has just disappeared. It very efficient last time since you would see if it's completed or submitted with regards to your status.

At times after keying in correct details to log in, pop out box stating digital token was set wrongly and need to re install app. Even the homepage of the app is flickering. What is going on here POSB? Please do somthing about all these issue.

when I type in the SMS secure pin, why do I need to close the keyboard just because the submit button is hidden behind it? that's poor design. it should be placed on the TOP right hand corner of the token window.

Installed on 19 Apr 2022 Tue, and tried to activate the OneToken (the replacement for the physical token) on the app. Unsuccessful. After going through days of trying, 5 customer service personnels, and references of my case to the technical department, I still failed to get the OneToken up and running.

1) It wants to know your location when you are using the app.

2) It wants to know your location when you are NOT using the app.

All told I needed to call their help desk three times over two weeks and be put on hold for 15-30 minutes each time. And wait for the new hardware token to be delivered to me. 

And like someone pointed out - this is a single point of failure. I ran the risk of not paying my bills on time while I was trying to sort out the above. The hardware token is rendered useless while the mobile token is activated.

1691,1,"Poor reliability : Despite updates and bug fixes, the OCBC app leaves much to be desired. Simple reliability is not in-built - many app crashes and disability to launch.

The bank is so big but so poor that the app is not willing to upgrade,0,
1695,2,Poor UI and experience : So many clicks to get a transfer or payment done. No favourites or shortcuts to make regular payments/ transfer easier.

1696,2,"Extremely buggy : Poorly designed and buggy app. I don’t understand why I have to scan my Face ID twice, once just for opening the app, and another time via singpass.

1802,3,Excessive fanciful animations at the startup : It would be great if there’s an option to disable the fanciful transition and animations when opening the app. A much faster startup would definitely benefit the already-fast pace of transactions.,0,
1803,1,"Terrible log-in process : After the latest update, I cant even use the app at all anymore. I have activated FaceID multiple times. And now after scanning my face, it just hangs on the “hello” page or prompts me to log in again with my user and password. After I tap on “login” it once again hangs there. What’s the point?!",0,
1804,1,"App very slow and does not show credit cards account : App is very slow since the recent update. The revamp layout is missing some information, e.g credit card accounts. Only can see transactions and this does not give a complete picture. Prefer the old layout.",0,
1805,1,"The new transfer UI is really sucked : No sure why recently it comes with the new transfer UI which is a bit messy and not clear comparing with the old transfer UI. Not sure why ocbc not going to improve the app launch performance but keep adding some stupid idea like this, poor product team they are.",0,
1806,4,"Issue with Face ID token : Been trying to activate the Face ID but somehow app never recognised. Other than that it has been a good app, minimal issues. Would have given 5 stars if not for the Face ID token issue.",0,
1807,3,"Menu bar : Menu is not intuitive for first time users. It takes abit of navigating to find things like one token set up and figure out how to transfer with “fast” as we don’t see the word “fast”. Once set up, its okay.",0,
1808,3,"Latest app cannot use : Hi, 
      I just update my OCBC app and it is not working now. Previous version was working good. The face reconization after click then just nothing happen. Tried token also prompt me not available.

1810,1,"iPhone gets heated up : I am using iPhone 12 and on latest ios 14.4.1.  Even with the latest version of the app and iOS, using this app for just a min will heat up my phone. It will take several minutes for the phone to cool down after killing off the app. 

This problem has happened for a number of months already. Please fix it.",0,
1811,5,The worst : Your activation is not successful. After trying 10 times I still cannot activate my new phone. Then somehow it activated at 12:47 am  WTH!,0,
1812,1,Worse app. Terrible. Deserve to be taken down. : They encourage digital banking yet they cant even get an app right. Embarrassment for a bank this big and dominating. Shows how useless and not trustworthy this is. I will close my bank account soon enough at this rate. Crashes every single time i log in. Sick of downloading and deleting this app over and over again.,0,
1813,1,"Worst banking app ever : Everything is so unintuitive. Didn’t understand how my card worked at all and ended up incurring hundreds of interest fee over a few months. There’s many apps for you to refer to in the market, maybe take a look at how they work to make your app less confusing to use.",0,
1814,1,Cant transfer funds out : It has been a week since i last had this issue. I have been trying to Paynow through UEN to make payment. I am unable to do that since a week ago. So much trouble to withdraw from atm and deposit into other banks in order for me to make online payment,0,
1815,1,"Token require for 2nd time authentication : Very lousy n not efficient. In the past using local transfer function can use SMS to authenticate the transaction now changed to token method. Very troublesome. When token not suddenly not working, all payment delayed cause us additional charges and still need time to go request for replacement.",0,
1816,1,Poor app - very frustrating. : have to exit app and re-login multiple times just to view my accounts or do any form of transactions. Very frustrating. All the app updates can never fix the backend connection of the bank app to their server. Just terrible! same for ocbc PayNow. Just gave up on that too.,0,

1818,2,"Many issues : Whenever I try to login this app, it will show me blank page. Have to try and try few times then can login. When using halfway, show blank page again. Wonder if the app has been hacked ??? Can help to resolve this issue? It is very frustrating to use.",0,
1819,5,Transfer to local : Fast and convenient!,0,
1820,1,"Terrible : If I could give it zero stars I would. They still haven’t not fixed the push notification glitch.

Please fix it ASAP. Thank you.",0,
1825,2,"Not working with Singtel Mobile : This app will not work with Singtel, it will cause the spinning wheel and just freezes, hence you are seeing so many users feedback of slow performance. Once I switches to m1 it will be fine. Can you get someone locally to test your application?",0,
1826,1,"Buck up. : Unable to authorize OneToken on my new phone and worst of all, couldnt even get things logged into my apple watch OCBC app. Whenever I want to activate apple watch, it appears nothing but a blank white screen. Fix la please. 2021 already but IT Developer team cannot make a basic app for consumers? POSB and UOB are doing so so much better than you guys please. Buck up.",0,
1827,1,"Can’t access the app : After I close the pop-up on push notifications by clicking “Okay, got it” I get this message saying that the app is temporarily unavailable and to check my internet connection and relaunch. I’ve done all of that and still getting the same error message. Lousy app.",0,
1828,1,"OCBC app : Unable to add a new payee for bill payment despite the successful addition of a new payee. When I tried to add the payee again, it states ‘record already exists’ but I do not find the account in the list of account payee I have added.

Took me more than an hour to pay a bill and worse, the issue still persists. OCBC please do something about this. Thank you",0,
1829,3,Slow and cluttered : Loading is slow. Interface is not user friendly. Cluttered with a lot of features that most people do not need.,0,
1830,1,"Not User Friendly : Super user unfriendly. I had a super hard time locating my e-statement and super hard time retrieving my transactions. Not to mention finding the transactions history for the past few months. 😓

Would appreciate if OCBC can do something about it as I would very much like to stay with OCBC. Perhaps can learn from DBS. 😄",0,
1831,3,Sudden change in security policies : Caught by surprise I cannot use the app as oCbc was “ aware” some apps on my phone was not from official play store. I have to manoeuvre differently and that caused me some down time in my business.,0,

1834,2,No last login date & time : There isn’t a function to check my last login date and time. This would allows user to know whether any illegal log in was made. POSB has that which is very useful.,0,
1835,3,Login take too long : Front page loading and log in takes longer than other bank apps.,0,
1836,1,"Bad UI and long loading times : Truly haven’t seen a worse app than OCBC, compared to all the other banks. Not only do the transactions don’t tally with estatement (missing some) when clicking all, it is constantly loading. Please fix your app, your competitors are way ahead of you.",0,
1837,5,Easy to transfer : It was very easy to do pay now,0,
1838,1,App problem : The security of the app is really an issue. I put a transfer to party A but at confirmation page it showed party B. Redo it 3x (thought I made an error) and same thing happened. Finally I restarted the whole process to get it fixed.  I really think we need to be extra careful with OCBC. Imagine if I was not careful …,0,
1839,1,Intercept : This pop up question is annoying. This star thing got no meaning of good or bad or allow me to tell the bank what to improve. I used to get a call with proper questions.

1843,1,"Scam Warning Screen : Can we not have the scam warning screen every single time we open the app? It’s breaks the flow of using the app, especially Paynow. Because of a few person who fell for the scams, now everyone has to live with this. I think people will close accounts if this persists as I find the app unusable.",0,
1844,3,Transfer Limit : Please show the funds transfer limit and allow changes of the limit on the app. Thank you.,0,
1845,1,"Worst banking app : Slow and hangs continually moving from one request to another.  Using this app is time consuming and wonder why OCBC bothers having a banking app.  It will ruin its reputation.  I deleted the app and reinstalled it as suggested by a phone banker, and now I cannot even access it after using my pin as instructed.  Disappointing and have lots to complain.",0,

I would hope to see credit review functions in it as well",0,
1852,2,"Weirdest design ever : Dear designer, system analysts, business analysts,

Please think about this, you are using the only smartphone you had to do a fund transfer, and this transaction required OneToken, and the activated device for OneToken is this only smartphone. Please explain, how am I able to get the token key?????????",0,
