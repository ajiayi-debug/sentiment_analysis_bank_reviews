0,2020-03-01 04:14:38,The OTP to create a new billing payee was sent to my email account? Why the sudden change? Furthermore when I get out of the app to retrieve the OTP and get back to the app by switching (I did not turn off the app) the whole app reset and I had to recreate from the beginning when I switched back the ‚Äúwindow‚Äù on my iOS. Does that mean I now need more than one device to create a new billing organisation payee? Why the huge inconvenience? If I‚Äôm outside and have only my phone how can I create a billing organisation payee easily? The Face ID issue was only resolved after I reset the app and had to change my settings back to enable Face ID. Most likely this issue occurred when the app was updated but this is the first time.

Only problem that I feel needs improvement is the duration of how long y'all take to maintain the app, as we users sometimes are promised a fixed timing whereby we can resume using the app, but when we are on the main page of the app, it indicates that the maintenance still isn't over and that causes a lot of problems as we cannot complete, let's say an important transaction that is really urgent and needs to be done as soon as possible.
