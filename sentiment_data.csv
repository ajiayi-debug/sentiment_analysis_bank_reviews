We're glad that 2.68% was implemented as soon as possible, but unfortunately we also have two things we're working through here that may affect our results.

GXS just come out with a reason to say many consumers want a increase in interest rate in main accounts as most of their funds are there to get the 1.2x points for dash and grab spending. Hence they decrease the interest rate to 2.68% in saving account and increase to 2.38% in main account .

The thing is GXS can increase the main account interest and maintain the interest rate in saving account. They will attract more consumer in this case. However, they use this opportunity to decease the interest rate in saving account instead and use the consumer as an excuse for the decrease.

I am very disappointed in GXS and have close my account in GXS. There are other banks offering a higher interest rate such as OCBC and UOB for saving accounts.
