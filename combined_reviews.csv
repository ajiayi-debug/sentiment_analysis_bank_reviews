GXS just come out with a reason to say many consumers want a increase in interest rate in main accounts as most of their funds are there to get the 1.2x points for dash and grab spending. Hence they decrease the interest rate to 2.68% in saving account and increase to 2.38% in main account .

The thing is GXS can increase the main account interest and maintain the interest rate in saving account. They will attract more consumer in this case. However, they use this opportunity to decease the interest rate in saving account instead and use the consumer as an excuse for the decrease.

I am very disappointed in GXS and have close my account in GXS. There are other banks offering a higher interest rate such as OCBC and UOB for saving accounts. No point sticking to GXS.",0

331,,5,Face ID and OTP issues : The OTP to create a new billing payee was sent to my email account? Why the sudden change? Furthermore when I get out of the app to retrieve the OTP and get back to the app by switching (I did not turn off the app) the whole app reset and I had to recreate from the beginning when I switched back the “window” on my iOS. Does that mean I now need more than one device to create a new billing organisation payee? Why the huge inconvenience? If I’m outside and have only my phone how can I create a billing organisation payee easily? The Face ID issue was only resolved after I reset the app and had to change my settings back to enable Face ID. Most likely this issue occurred when the app was updated but this is the first time. Not sure what has happened to the quality control and processes that were in place before. Things are not as clear as before.,0
332,,5,"Easy to use & simple to understand : I find that the POSB digibank app is very easy to use and that everything is pretty simple for us users & consumers to understand. Only problem that I feel needs improvement is the duration of how long y'all take to maintain the app, as we users sometimes are promised a fixed timing whereby we can resume using the app, but when we are on the main page of the app, it indicates that the maintenance still isn't over and that causes a lot of problems as we cannot complete, let's say an important transaction that is really urgent and needs to be done as soon as possible. Other than that, I don't think there's any other issues regarding the app. As a whole, a great app and a very useful platform for users & consumers.",0
333,,5,"The best digital banking app in Singapore! : I absolutely love the POSB Digibank app! It has made managing my finances so much easier and convenient. The user interface is clean and intuitive, and I can easily view my account balances and transaction history. The app also has a lot of useful features, such as the ability to transfer money to other accounts and pay bills. I particularly like the fact that I can set up custom notifications to stay on top of my spending. Overall, I highly recommend the POSB Digibank app to anyone who wants a simple and effective way to manage their money.",0
334,,4,"Accessing digital token when logged in. : Well introducing digital token is a great move and I like the fact I can use it without entering otp and that it is a seamless way to make payments. There is one caveat tho - The way the app allows you to access the digital token. Well u can access the token via the splash screen when u on the app. Great! But upon login, the digital token is not accessible or not that I know of after using this feature for almost a year. I find myself in a situation where I have to log out or force close the app and reopening it to access the digital token.  
Sometimes I need to make sure I have funds before I want to make payment but I can’t get the app to either automatically respond to the payment I’m trying to make and there is no way to access digital token when login inside. Hopefully something can be made to resolve this.",0
335,,4,"Payment Controls Monthly Spend Tracking : Under Payment Controls > Monthly Spend Limit, there is a Current Spend tracking. However, as I was told by CSO that this Current Spend follows a monthly cycle that starts on the day that Monthly Spend Limit is toggled on. Let’s say I toggled on the Limit on 13 Feb, this will trigger the Current Spend to start tracking spending from 13 Feb - 12 Mar. Over time I tend not to remember this cycle (when it starts and ends) and the entire spend tracking is rendered meaningless. Wonder if change Limit midway, will it also change the tracking cycle? Hope to see a spend tracking based on calendar month controlled by monthly spend limit.",0
336,,5,"Best bank app in Sg : POSB digibank app is the best banking app in Singapore I’ve used. I have all 3 major bank apps and a few other banks app. Digibank is fast, clear and easy to use. Unlike other banking apps, there is no lag when moving from 1 screen to another 👍🏼

337,,1,"Bank app causes phone to get very hot within 1min of use : When I start up the app on my new iPhone 12 which I got in Jan 2021, it causes the phone to get very hot within 1 min. The problem became worse when I upgraded to iOS 14.4. After using the bank app, my phone functions will fail (eg I can’t open apps, can’t download mails, can’t sync to iCloud). Upgrading to iOS 14.4.1 did not help either. I have to restart my phone every time these issues occur. The issue recurs again when I use the bank app. It is unsustainable to keep restarting the phone every time I use the bank app. Given how essential a bank app is (now that the app acts as the digital token and physical tokens are phased out by the bank), I hope that both Apple’s and DBS’ teams can work together to resolve this issue.",0
338,,1,"Violates App Store policies : This DBS/POSB banking app blatantly misuses push notification access for the purpose of advertising. App Store policy: 

4.5.4 Push Notifications must not be required for the app to function, and should not be used to send sensitive personal or confidential information. Push Notifications should not be used for promotions or direct marketing purposes unless customers have explicitly opted in to receive them via consent language displayed in your app’s UI, and you provide a method in your app for a user to opt out from receiving such messages. Abuse of these services may result in revocation of your privileges.

This is a word-for-word popup from the app: With app (push) notifications, never miss: 

1. Offers you wish you knew sooner 

2. Protips to spend wisely 

3. Smart insights meant for you. On a banking app, I would definitely want push notifications for security purposes, such as transactions and login or Digital 2FA token notifications. 

However, I can only either accept the marketing spam (promos etc) or not have these important notifications at all.",0
339,,3,"Connection : I’m unable to login when I’m on mobile data, even after clearing of cache, or restart of the iPhone. When attempting to login, it will cause data cut to the other apps too; unless I kill all the apps and switching on/off the airplane mode to re-established a connection with the mobile service. 

Sometimes, almost never, i can log in, but! as i tap on any of my account, it will throw an error message saying “your system encountered a momentary Technical difficulty...” the same error as logging in or any of the area in the app. 

It will only work fine, on wireless connection. Of course, I’m in an open area, full coverage of 4G, and even tried using it during midday afternoon or super late in the midnight. Same result even no peak hour traffic. So i still think its the app. Because i can do every mobile data related to every other app but yours. 

I hope the development team can take a look into this, because its causing a lot of inconveniences.",0
340,,2,"Fix the terrible performance : Every single update says “performance improvements” but every single time I open the app, my phone gets hot and the battery starts going down about 1% per minute. Are POSB mining Bitcoin on our phones?

Because of this, I use the app as little as possible. But giving more than 1 star since it’s still better than UOB’s app.

It would be more usable if we could give nicknames to bill payments, I have 2 accounts with M1 but POSB only lets me identify them by the 9 digit account number so I need to try to remember which is which every time I need to make a manual payment.",0

342,,1,App affects mobile connection : An app that affects phone mobile connection when used. Mobile connection will stop working when app is used. It will start to connect when app is started and after a while the app will stop responding saying there is an issue with internet connection. Only then user will find the rest of the apps will also stop working as there is no internet connection from the phone.  Workaround is to enable airplane mode and disable it again to bring back the connection. A simple transaction will sometimes require a few of such actions before it can be completed. Really lousy experience.,0

344,,4,"Good app, best in the market in terms of functionality. But one basic feature lacking : This is by far the best banking app on the market. The ability to view all my assets and liabilities in one place is very useful. 

Suffice to say, I’ve started investing in DBS’ funds offerings just to keep everything in one place and easily tracked. 

One major gripe I have with DBS, is that the cards spend is not immediately reflected in card’s balance. If you refer to other banking apps, 1 -2 days after making a purchase on the credit card, immediately you’ll find the outstanding balance (not to be confused with statement balance) on the app. Which makes for easy tracking. 

This is the main reason why I’ve used UOB or Amex rather than DBS credit cards. I can’t track my monthly expenditure on a go with ease. 

Perhaps the team should really look into unlocking this feature.",0

My other back debit card was successfully set up though and I only have 2 cards to add. The messages either show: 1 - Could not add card/Card not added.

1. Enable FaceID but it does not work! I still need to enter my PIN to log in. 
2. After entering my PIN, I receive an error message “This service isn’t available now...” and I’ll need to restart the app multiple times before I’m able to log in. 
3. Repeatedly asks me to set up my digital token even though I did it ages ago. 
4. Where is the Comment box for transfers? It is useful as I can inform the other party what the transfer is for.
5. Sometimes, I’m only able to make a transfer once. Attempting a 2nd transfer will result in the above mentioned error message.

351,,5,"Efficient and hassle free apps : This app gets all the major tasks that we need for our day to day business with banking done quite efficiently. There is no lag and no crash for me this far.

This is so tiring come on you want to be the biggest bank in SEA but the app you make works terrible, probably the most annoying app on my phone right now.

1338,,2,"Biometric login | Quick peek gone aft update? : Have always lauded TouchID login as a key game changer to friends as it really speeds up the process and makes PayNow / Scan to Pay a breeze (rest of waiting time mostly on sending and receiving of transaction status).

It was mysteriously gone after an app update. After having read the reviews, realised FaceID is not supported as well.
Please make biometric login a priority as this is key to a good / secure mobile banking app.

*balance Quick peek unfortunately has also been missing after my last update.*

If implementing Face ID in a future update, perhaps would be a good time to do a ‘iOS12’ styled version as well. To fine tune critical features and fix bugs in existing ones.

A future feature request would be to be able to streamline e interface further and allow user to customise e home screen to hide lesser used functions and bring most common ones forward.

OCBC’s interface is nice to look at, but TouchID login process is limited and app crashes time to time upon conducting transactions.

Hope POSB’s versions moves forward at a steady and measured pace. To add stuff and improve w each iteration w/o breaking any existing features*",0
1339,,4,"POSB digibank : Well. After the latest update, things really do seem smoother. 
However when making payments to other bank's credit card, it becomes tricky. Because the banks logos do not appear. Instead, a large yellow dot with the letter L in the center appears as the logo. And all the other credit cards will have that same logo. So stupid!
So every time I make a credit card payment to say UOB, I have to remember my credit card number. Because there's this yellow logo, and all the other credit cards have the same yellow logo with the letter L. Surely DBS can do better. 
Thank you.",0
1340,,4,"lagging behind other banks : Other banks provide better login methods (faster and uses good FaceID). POSB/DBS need to catch up. Heard a new app is coming, hope key functions such as amount used on credit card will be there (instead of having to manually available limit minus from the total limit to calculate it. You should also always display pending transactions (citibank and UOB are already doing it - don’t understand why the “best” bank in singapore doesn’t have any of these functions. Was disappointed when I tried to find any of these key features.",0
1341,,4,"Great Improvement from previous App, but... : Now it's a lot more interactive with nice clean layout with convenient access to what you want. With Touch ID, it's much easier to log in. 

Regarding this issue, when I close the app using the home button and return back to the app via home screen or multi task window, there's no verification with Touch ID again, that's a security compromise. It would be better if there's always a request for Touch ID. When popping in and out of the app.",0
1342,,4,"Nice improved app but need tweaking : Its a nice refreshing app but first thing i noticed is the font and numbers are too small in the balance amount.

1343,,3,"Great features, some broken : Paynow is fantastic. A lot of services are at my fingertips which makes life a lot easier. But one thing that has been broken for a while on the iOS version is the phonebook search in PayNow. Typing a friend's name doesn't bring up a filtered drop down for me to select from. It's just completely broken. Copy pasting a phone number ends up being truncated too. So in the end I always have to manually key in phone numbers to make a transfer.

When I saw the digits literally not moving after I spent some money, I went to the ATM machine to check and my balance was really different from what I saw on the app. Yes it was a surprise for me to realize the digits I've been seeing is not updated at all for quite some time. Please help fix this issue. I love using this app cuz it's v useful and user-friendly. I would like to give it 5 stars again.",0
1345,,1,"Slow : Before the update , everything was so smooth and neat , it’s basically zero effort be it transaction wise as well as checking of balance and all 
However after the update , checking of balance was slow and all , everything requires SMS Pin and all , it really slowed down the whole process by a lot as it was once easily done with fingerprint scanning 

Besides the whole SMS pin problem , sometimes it showed incorrect pin even though it was the right one , and i had to leave the app first , then enter back the app to be able to access to the page that i want

You see , maybe instead of trying to improve useless stuffs , what not just bring back the old one which was smooth and fast , I feel that for us users , nothing beats quick and efficiency , we just need our stuffs quick , and not a slow process like this 

It’s really quite disappointing as i once liked the app a lot and introduced it to a lot of my friends",0

At times after keying in correct details to log in, pop out box stating digital token was set wrongly and need to re install app. Even the homepage of the app is flickering. What is going on here POSB? Please do somthing about all these issue.

Even after following the live agent’s suggestions of deleting the app and reinstalling it again, it doesn’t work. Then they had to manually delete the digital token on their end (so that I can set it up again), I thought that there would be hope, but the authentication STILL doesn’t work.

So brings me back to my point; what’s the point of this utterly useless app when you can’t use it?

Utterly useless.",0

when I type in the SMS secure pin, why do I need to close the keyboard just because the submit button is hidden behind it? that's poor design. it should be placed on the TOP right hand corner of the token window.

1929,,2,"- : Genuinely surprised to see this app having such a high rating. However upon looking through the reviews, I realised that there are many reviews voicing their frustrations only to have a 5 star rating pinned to it. Perhaps users aren’t familiar with the rating system. Anyway, this app is really unreliable. A common issue being…….app is not able to load at all, and if it did, another issue users might face would be the app being ‘temporarily unavailable’. In the event that users finally manage to enter the app, there will be times where users get logged out almost immediately due to ‘long periods of inactivity’. Truly dysfunctional. Whenever I intend to make a transaction via PayNow, I always check this app in advance as i truly have no idea when there would be errors in logging in (which then affects whether I am able to PayNow). This app has been problematic since forever so i’m really not sure why it hasn’t significantly improved i mean isn’t the loading of the app and the log in something BASIC? I’m not even talking about how user friendly (or not) the app is, or about how the app could be potentially lacking in terms of features, or about the layout of the app etc. I just want the app to be FUNCTIONING in the first place",0

I thought that OCBC has finally over come the technological barriers to bring forth a stable app. How wrong of me. Installed on 19 Apr 2022 Tue, and tried to activate the OneToken (the replacement for the physical token) on the app. Unsuccessful. After going through days of trying, 5 customer service personnels, and references of my case to the technical department, I still failed to get the OneToken up and running. 

Oh wow!! How patient I am!! But now I have given up, and asked the customer service personnel to close the case even when the problem is not solved. I have since uninstalled the app.

This app still need more work to it to be fully functional. — 5 May 2022 Thu

Update: Something I left out. For those who are concerned with privacy, should note what this OCBC banking app does.

1) It wants to know your location when you are using the app.

2) It wants to know your location when you are NOT using the app.

3) It will scan your wifi network when you are on wifi.

That’s a lot more than other banking apps I’ve used before.

To require deletion of third party apps before being allowed to use the app is such an out of touch decision, making the lives of people who use such apps knowingly and securely all that much harder. A pity since this app was very useful to have. An alternative approach would be instead to not _force_ deletion, but rather make the user aware, and allow them to continue their transaction at their own risk.

1) I downloaded the eStatement from mobile App. When I tried to erase balance using iPhone in-build Apps, password was needed. However, after I entered the password, it’s said to be invalid.
2) I tried to reset it on mobile Apps according to the instructions given on OCBC website but the system kept on telling me that there is an error, without specifying what the error was.
3) I called OCBC customer service, it took sometime for the officer to figure out that “Password can only be changed from internet banking on computer”. I followed the steps instructed by the officer to change the password and used the new password to enable editing of the eStatement that was downloaded after the reset of password, it did not work either. It took altogether 45 minutes for the customer officer to troubleshoot and guide me through all the tedious and illogical steps on internet banking and mobile Apps, nothing worked at all.",0

Changed to a new device and OneToken doesn’t work at all, apparently I needed to authorise it using my old phone, which thankfully I still had, but that function didn’t work too. I was asked to request for a new hardware token just to activate the app on my new phone. And THAT didn’t work too until I was told to delete and reinstall the app. 

All told I needed to call their help desk three times over two weeks and be put on hold for 15-30 minutes each time. And wait for the new hardware token to be delivered to me. 

And like someone pointed out - this is a single point of failure. I ran the risk of not paying my bills on time while I was trying to sort out the above. The hardware token is rendered useless while the mobile token is activated.

I use iphone ios 12, and after the app loads and opens all i see is the ocbc logo in the page as if it is going to load the page. But, nothing happens after that point; not even like it is hung; just that page. I don’t know what is the issue. Haven’t been able to login to my online banking for a while now as if i do so from the laptop too it asks for app otp or app aunthentication!",0
1999,,5,Improve sharing image : It is best if you could improve by sharing image after done the PayNow or bank transfer instead of we have to screenshot the whole image rather than just sharing the texts that we have transferred the payment. Like how Uob does.,0

2009,,1,"Getting bad to worst : Is there a new IT team? App performance getting from bad to worst! OCBC app to be good many years ago but lately it has been so buggy and problematic. In terms of intuitiveness, responsiveness and logic of app design, other banks are surpassing OCBC. Do the team even test the app out whenever they roll out something new? I’m writing this review with frustration now as the OneToken is not working and I basically cannot perform any banking as the web version requires OneToken too. This is horrendous for a highly digital era.",0
2010,,1,"Catastrophic failure of app : Mobile and online banking all depend on the one token, creating a single point of failure. This failure has been total, tantamount to the bank closing down for a few days, locking out access to our funds without providing an alternative. 

By denying access to all banking functions, money has been locked up without the customer’s permission, the bank has failed at the very basic premise of being a bank.

How will anyone ever trust that the online banking platform again? 

That’s without considering all the people who were inconvenienced, even embarrassed when they had to explain to others why they could not send the money cos “the bank app failed”. 

Yah right... 

So the only question left now is how will you make this right?",0

2022,,1,"Poor reliability : Despite updates and bug fixes, the OCBC app leaves much to be desired. Simple reliability is not in-built - many app crashes and disability to launch. A half-baked banking app that heats up my phone to temperatures akin to the surface of the sun - why? I don’t even think the developers know.

I can’t get out of the interface after waiting for a few minutes. It just keeps going around and around and I don’t know what to do! Can you put your heart into making your app? The bank is so big but so poor that the app is not willing to upgrade,0
2026,,2,Poor UI and experience : So many clicks to get a transfer or payment done. No favourites or shortcuts to make regular payments/ transfer easier. Have my feedback through phone and it was useless. Words are too small.  You can see where their focus is when new updates keep adding new bloat but not actual improvements.,0
2027,,2,"Extremely buggy : Poorly designed and buggy app. I don’t understand why I have to scan my Face ID twice, once just for opening the app, and another time via singpass. Seems like the first scan is unnecessary as it doesn’t do anything. Lately, I can’t even log in, as the first Face ID scan will revert me back to the login page in a never ending loop.",0

2033,,3,"App is getting slower by the day : It used to be fine, but ever since the anti scam notice update, the app has been slow and buggy. After FaceID verification the loader doesn’t move away which mandates an app restart, and sometimes certain menu options cause the app to load non-stop.",0

Very limited features and payment options, Ltd peer-to-peer options, limited consumer payment options to merchants example top ups to prepaid cards et cetera.

2107,,1,"Fee waiver submission time duration : The holding time duration for hotline call-in submission of fee/ interest waiver is very short and seemingly deliberate—if I don’t have my physical cc with me, I’ll need to toggle back and forth with the OCBC app to key in the 16 digits, but the manner which the holding time is configured, which is short shrift, gives the impression that OCBC is dismissive about such submissions. Lousiest impression of such customer service.",0

And now after scanning my face, it just hangs on the “hello” page or prompts me to log in again with my user and password. After I tap on “login” it once again hangs there. What’s the point?!",0
2135,,1,"App very slow and does not show credit cards account : App is very slow since the recent update. The revamp layout is missing some information, e.g credit card accounts. Only can see transactions and this does not give a complete picture. Prefer the old layout.",0
2136,,1,"The new transfer UI is really sucked : No sure why recently it comes with the new transfer UI which is a bit messy and not clear comparing with the old transfer UI.

Sick of downloading and deleting this app over and over again.,0
2144,,1,"Worst banking app ever : Everything is so unintuitive. Didn’t understand how my card worked at all and ended up incurring hundreds of interest fee over a few months.
