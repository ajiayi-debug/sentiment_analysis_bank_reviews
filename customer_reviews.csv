4,App can have more features! : Great banking app with attractive interest rates! Please allow us to add and/or save payees so we don’t have to keep typing out UEN numbers or account numbers. Would be nice to be able to add the debit card to Apple Pay too!!,2024-03-06 08:36:37,1
5,A big bang! : A bank like no other no bank have such amazing feature to separate your money into different “pockets” to keep track of your goals. Moreover the interest rate they give is the highest for the no effort! Interest are being deposit daily and it’s amazing to see 💵 coming in to the bank daily! The user interfaces is so intuitive that every button can be found with your eyes close that makes money transfer so much smoother. Also the colours is so slick that I want to turn the app on everyday just to look at it and see the daily interestLots of potential for the product and I can’t wait to see more of it.,2022-11-09 03:13:16,1
1,Unreasonable drop in interest rate : Notice that the drop in interest rate of 0.8% in saving accounts. GXS just come out with a reason to say many consumers want a increase in interest rate in main accounts as most of their funds are there to get the 1.2x points for dash and grab spending. Hence they decrease the interest rate to 2.68% in saving account and increase to 2.38% in main account .The thing is GXS can increase the main account interest and maintain the interest rate in saving account. They will attract more consumer in this case. However they use this opportunity to decease the interest rate in saving account instead and use the consumer as an excuse for the decrease.I am very disappointed in GXS and have close my account in GXS. There are other banks offering a higher interest rate such as OCBC and UOB for saving accounts. No point sticking to GXS.,2023-09-09 08:33:43,-1
2,Unable to transfer funds back to myself : Sending money into my GXS account is a breeze and instantaneous - regardless of the amounts. I’m able to immediately see that my funds are in GXS. Transferring money OUT is a huge issue. Since June I’ve had problems transferring amounts higher than $500 back to my other banking accounts each time a red banner will pop up and said something went wrong please try again later. TODAY I can’t transfer more than $1000 back to myself - even the $1000 had to be transferred in TWO transactions of $500 each. Customer service officers did their best to help each time but it’s annoying that the advice provided (killing the app re-logging in with SingPass) still don’t work.,2023-06-27 04:01:39,-1
5,Potentially the best UI/UX among all the new digibanks : I have to say that the UI/UX is one of the best one I’ll have seen for any Digibank mobile app and finally a strong market player that focuses on customer experience and design which is critical as most banking products doesn’t differ much for any banks out there. Please make it available asap can’t wait to see what you have to offer!,2022-10-02 04:17:49,1
1,Not for everyone (even if we want) : Have been waiting for a slot for the account since GXS started and have been waiting until now (about 7 months) and still nothing whenever anyone ask for why the excuses given are still mostly the same with no actual changes or improvements (people can’t help but compare to the other bank “trust bank Singapore” that also launched just 1 day before GXS’s launch and believe trust bank Singapore to be better since trust bank can allow people to register without waiting for this long),2023-04-23 14:54:16,-1
5,A great banking app experience that serves it’s purpose : Great app with awesome design and theme unlike traditional banking institutions. Provide high interest rates and suitable for targeted group of audience. Ratings were probably dragged down by reviewers who rated 1/5 because they couldn’t sign up - as GXS bank is rolling out to users by batches.Overall a good experience! :),2023-01-05 07:08:13,1
1,Very unstable banking app : Hit with fast reversal when transferring money to this gxs bank first time in my life a fast transfer didn’t succeed. Googled for recent reviews and social media on this gxs bank. Mostly bad reviews and issues. I don’t need developer reply to my review here as I’m absolutely not going to touch this bank anymore. And biggest joke of all you don’t even have the most basic banking feature to save payee details. What kind of app development staff and quality is that???,2023-09-13 15:30:05,-1
5,Good features : Very easy to use user friendly and intuitive. Nice design of the app making it easier to navigate the app. Saving pocket is an interesting and useful feature. can’t wait to explore and use more of the app,2022-12-10 11:32:55,1
1,Digital Bank? 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 : What a joke! Nothing happens after you input your phone number - nothing! It’ll be so much and I don’t exaggerate when I say this so much faster for you to travel from one end of Singapore to the other to open an account at a traditional bank branch. One piece of advice to the management of GXS Bank - do not launch if you are not ready! You are a joke. Please look at Trust Bank. Simple and easy to use. Account opened in like 2 mins?,2022-09-08 07:14:48,-1
5,Great deposit benefits : Honestly is my first time depositing digital banking A lot worry . But at the end is a great experience. I believe a lot of us wanted is the return . And they offer very high interest. Will continue to deposit Thank you,2023-11-21 09:22:11,1
1,No Payee Saving Makes Trnx Tedious : My biggest frustration is that I can’t save payees when sending money.  Everytime I need to transfer funds I have to select a transfer type and fully type out the account number payee’s name and select the bank.This is incredibly tedious esp for accounts I pay frequently. Without this “fundamental” feature a payee list it’s easy to make mistakes entering long account number name and bank name each time.,2023-08-22 10:22:46,-1
5,Best bank! : Best bank to save up and best bank in receiving cash back! And also so happy to be able to win a lucky draw from here! Hopefully things get much better in this year!,2024-01-11 08:48:28,1

5,User Friendly : The app’s interface is really user friendly and sleek! It loads very fast as well can’t wait to start using this digital bank app :),2022-12-16 02:50:05,1
1,One year yet not much improvement : Already 1 year but basic functions like adding payee is not in the app. It’s so troublesome to transfer funds to different bank accounts! With your latest move to reduce interest to 2.68% has made me feels like maribank is better even with slightly lower interest rate because they knows what basic functions to include in the app,2023-09-12 05:10:29,-1
1,Bad experience of this GXS app. Think again if you want to go cashless with this app! : Extremely disappointed with the GXS app. Despite consistent use on the same device for a long time it suddenly stopped allowing money transfers with explanation device changed. This lack of clarity and abrupt disruption in service is unacceptable. Terrible user experience deserves only 1 star.,2024-02-24 06:12:02,-1

1,Not Ready : Why put an app on the store when you are not ready. All about the app now is collecting info. If you have heard yet please use testflight for ur ‘launch’ aka beta testing 🤦🏻Update: doesn’t bode well… even response is so robotic n mundane. Might as well not respond and spend the time to build the app for a proper launch,2022-09-16 07:19:33,-1
1,Misleading Advertising : Noticed the news writing they offer 3.48% interest rate. After downloading the apps and trying to sign up end up asked me to fill up my particular to  receive latest buzz updates.! If the bank isn’t planing to offer please stop advertising that.

5,Face ID and OTP issues : The OTP to create a new billing payee was sent to my email account? Why the sudden change? Furthermore when I get out of the app to retrieve the OTP and get back to the app by switching (I did not turn off the app) the whole app reset and I had to recreate from the beginning when I switched back the “window” on my iOS. Does that mean I now need more than one device to create a new billing organisation payee? Why the huge inconvenience? If I’m outside and have only my phone how can I create a billing organisation payee easily? The Face ID issue was only resolved after I reset the app and had to change my settings back to enable Face ID. Most likely this issue occurred when the app was updated but this is the first time. Not sure what has happened to the quality control and processes that were in place before. Things are not as clear as before.,2020-03-01 04:14:38,1
5,Easy to use & simple to understand : I find that the POSB digibank app is very easy to use and that everything is pretty simple for us users & consumers to understand. Only problem that I feel needs improvement is the duration of how long y'all take to maintain the app as we users sometimes are promised a fixed timing whereby we can resume using the app but when we are on the main page of the app it indicates that the maintenance still isn't over and that causes a lot of problems as we cannot complete let's say an important transaction that is really urgent and needs to be done as soon as possible. Other than that I don't think there's any other issues regarding the app. As a whole a great app and a very useful platform for users & consumers.,2021-12-23 20:47:02,1
5,The best digital banking app in Singapore! : I absolutely love the POSB Digibank app! It has made managing my finances so much easier and convenient. The user interface is clean and intuitive and I can easily view my account balances and transaction history. The app also has a lot of useful features such as the ability to transfer money to other accounts and pay bills. I particularly like the fact that I can set up custom notifications to stay on top of my spending. Overall I highly recommend the POSB Digibank app to anyone who wants a simple and effective way to manage their money.,2022-12-12 02:43:20,1
4,Accessing digital token when logged in. : Well introducing digital token is a great move and I like the fact I can use it without entering otp and that it is a seamless way to make payments. There is one caveat tho - The way the app allows you to access the digital token. Well u can access the token via the splash screen when u on the app. Great! But upon login the digital token is not accessible or not that I know of after using this feature for almost a year. I find myself in a situation where I have to log out or force close the app and reopening it to access the digital token.  Sometimes I need to make sure I have funds before I want to make payment but I can’t get the app to either automatically respond to the payment I’m trying to make and there is no way to access digital token when login inside. Hopefully something can be made to resolve this.,2020-11-09 01:44:36,1
4,Payment Controls Monthly Spend Tracking : Under Payment Controls > Monthly Spend Limit there is a Current Spend tracking. However as I was told by CSO that this Current Spend follows a monthly cycle that starts on the day that Monthly Spend Limit is toggled on. Let’s say I toggled on the Limit on 13 Feb this will trigger the Current Spend to start tracking spending from 13 Feb - 12 Mar. Over time I tend not to remember this cycle (when it starts and ends) and the entire spend tracking is rendered meaningless. Wonder if change Limit midway will it also change the tracking cycle? Hope to see a spend tracking based on calendar month controlled by monthly spend limit.,2024-02-13 11:05:23,1
5,Best bank app in Sg : POSB digibank app is the best banking app in Singapore I’ve used. I have all 3 major bank apps and a few other banks app. Digibank is fast clear and easy to use. Unlike other banking apps there is no lag when moving from 1 screen to another 👍🏼I wish the bank can lead other banks in savings & fixed deposits rates too 😅 There are areas the bank can do better which I will not mention here as it’s not directly related to the app.,2021-09-22 01:43:13,1
1,Bank app causes phone to get very hot within 1min of use : When I start up the app on my new iPhone 12 which I got in Jan 2021 it causes the phone to get very hot within 1 min. The problem became worse when I upgraded to iOS 14.4. After using the bank app my phone functions will fail (eg I can’t open apps can’t download mails can’t sync to iCloud). Upgrading to iOS 14.4.1 did not help either. I have to restart my phone every time these issues occur. The issue recurs again when I use the bank app. It is unsustainable to keep restarting the phone every time I use the bank app. Given how essential a bank app is (now that the app acts as the digital token and physical tokens are phased out by the bank) I hope that both Apple’s and DBS’ teams can work together to resolve this issue.,2021-03-30 13:52:10,-1
1,Violates App Store policies : This DBS/POSB banking app blatantly misuses push notification access for the purpose of advertising. App Store policy: 4.5.4 Push Notifications must not be required for the app to function and should not be used to send sensitive personal or confidential information. Push Notifications should not be used for promotions or direct marketing purposes unless customers have explicitly opted in to receive them via consent language displayed in your app’s UI and you provide a method in your app for a user to opt out from receiving such messages. Abuse of these services may result in revocation of your privileges.This is a word-for-word popup from the app: With app (push) notifications never miss: 1. Offers you wish you knew sooner 2. Protips to spend wisely 3. Smart insights meant for you. On a banking app I would definitely want push notifications for security purposes such as transactions and login or Digital 2FA token notifications. However I can only either accept the marketing spam (promos etc) or not have these important notifications at all.,2023-11-26 05:37:52,-1
3,Connection : I’m unable to login when I’m on mobile data even after clearing of cache or restart of the iPhone. When attempting to login it will cause data cut to the other apps too; unless I kill all the apps and switching on/off the airplane mode to re-established a connection with the mobile service. Sometimes almost never i can log in but! as i tap on any of my account it will throw an error message saying “your system encountered a momentary Technical difficulty...” the same error as logging in or any of the area in the app. It will only work fine on wireless connection. Of course I’m in an open area full coverage of 4G and even tried using it during midday afternoon or super late in the midnight. Same result even no peak hour traffic. So i still think its the app. Because i can do every mobile data related to every other app but yours. I hope the development team can take a look into this because its causing a lot of inconveniences.,2021-01-29 12:33:59,-1
2,Fix the terrible performance : Every single update says “performance improvements” but every single time I open the app my phone gets hot and the battery starts going down about 1% per minute. Are POSB mining Bitcoin on our phones?Because of this I use the app as little as possible. But giving more than 1 star since it’s still better than UOB’s app.It would be more usable if we could give nicknames to bill payments I have 2 accounts with M1 but POSB only lets me identify them by the 9 digit account number so I need to try to remember which is which every time I need to make a manual payment.,2021-09-22 03:32:25,-1
5,Posb digibank app lately- not stable : Of late the posb digibank is not stable. It hanged and took a very long time to open. This started last wk and today as well. I had to delete app and reinstalled to get it working.  After reinstalling it worked for awhile and then the same problem happens again like today. This is so disappointing and I wonder what happened. Please check thank you,2021-01-11 01:22:11,1
1,App affects mobile connection : An app that affects phone mobile connection when used. Mobile connection will stop working when app is used. It will start to connect when app is started and after a while the app will stop responding saying there is an issue with internet connection. Only then user will find the rest of the apps will also stop working as there is no internet connection from the phone.  Workaround is to enable airplane mode and disable it again to bring back the connection. A simple transaction will sometimes require a few of such actions before it can be completed. Really lousy experience.,2022-09-11 03:58:25,-1
4,Love this app and if u don’t have it get it now!! : Best banking app ever so easy to use once you learn to navigate.Quick so I can transfer money smoothly without any issues. Honestly a fantastic app and now it’s come with more enhanced features which make me more knowledgeable about my spending and earnings habits. Thank you the great app which makes life easier especially with banking. Financial health is important to look after to and this app makes it easy with detailed functions and also gives me an overview of everything.,2020-07-23 19:52:23,1
4,Good app best in the market in terms of functionality. But one basic feature lacking : This is by far the best banking app on the market. The ability to view all my assets and liabilities in one place is very useful. Suffice to say I’ve started investing in DBS’ funds offerings just to keep everything in one place and easily tracked. One major gripe I have with DBS is that the cards spend is not immediately reflected in card’s balance. If you refer to other banking apps 1 -2 days after making a purchase on the credit card immediately you’ll find the outstanding balance (not to be confused with statement balance) on the app. Which makes for easy tracking. This is the main reason why I’ve used UOB or Amex rather than DBS credit cards. I can’t track my monthly expenditure on a go with ease. Perhaps the team should really look into unlocking this feature.,2020-07-21 00:58:27,1
4,To view multiple Accounts : I used to see all my deposit accounts credit cards accounts in one page but not anymore. Every time I finished doing one transaction & I have to go to the home page click the down arrow to list all the accounts & view a specify account & back to home page & repeat this step all over again is not user friendly for this part overall experience in other transaction via this app are very fast & simple to use.,2020-07-19 03:46:02,1
3,Issues with adding apple pay on apple watch : I encountered issues with adding my POSB debit card for apple pay on apple watch. My other back debit card was successfully set up though and I only have 2 cards to add. The messages either show: 1 - Could not add card/Card not added. Contact your card issuer for more information; OR 2 - Apple Pay is unavailable. Try again later. I did reset both my iPhone and apple watch then logged in again but still have the same issues.,2021-06-04 02:07:46,-1
4,No option to delete / clear option for Notifications : There has no option to delete/clear option for Notifications after read. It will be much  better able to delte all the notifications which are just for info. Appreciate your immediate attention and add the option to delete in the next update. Thanks.,2023-06-27 00:29:57,1
2,Buggy app a shadow of its former self. : I used to love this app really enjoyed how seamless banking became with it. However it appears as though this app is on a decline. 1. Enable FaceID but it does not work! I still need to enter my PIN to log in. 2. After entering my PIN I receive an error message “This service isn’t available now...” and I’ll need to restart the app multiple times before I’m able to log in. 3. Repeatedly asks me to set up my digital token even though I did it ages ago. 4. Where is the Comment box for transfers? It is useful as I can inform the other party what the transfer is for.5. Sometimes I’m only able to make a transfer once. Attempting a 2nd transfer will result in the above mentioned error message.This app used to make my banking a breeze these days I get frustrated while using it. I’ve tried contacting POSB via their website to leave a feedback but I’m unable to find an avenue to do so.,2020-09-16 00:52:51,-1
1,Service Not Available poping up : When trying to login keep poping up Service Not Available. This service issue turned paynow and cashless payment into a hell of a problem. Can’t login meaning all transaction cannot be done. I have to relied on carrying lots of cash again.  Am an IPhone 14 user. I checked below review and I’m not the only one experiencing this issue. Have to keep refresh the app and at times cannot login means cannot login. I have checked on Wifi/5G/4G and phone is pretty new and experienced this issue island wide. Confirmed is app issue that’s been persistence for more than 2 weeks.,2023-06-28 16:39:36,-1
4,Great. Could be better : I like the budgeting feature. I ‘almost’ not using spreadsheet anymore.It could be improved if when setting up monthly budget I could also see how much I have budgeted on all categories so I can compare it with my income for the month and make sure I don’t budget too much. This is a no brainer. I ended up setting up my budget first on a spreadsheet  then copying the values to the app.,2022-07-19 03:16:07,1
5,Efficient and hassle free apps : This app gets all the major tasks that we need for our day to day business with banking done quite efficiently. There is no lag and no crash for me this far. However with issues like me wanting to know about the refinancing eligibility and other administrative matters relating to my loan I hope this app could provide recourse to those options as well.,2020-04-21 01:28:30,1
1,Worst worst app EVER : WHY do I have to log in at least 5 times before the app doesn’t prompt me that I’ve been logged out due to security purposes??? LIKE I’m in an urgent to transfer money from MY OWN ACCOUNT TO MY OWN ACCOUNT or I want to check the details of my previous transactions and ITS IMPOSSIBLE. This is so tiring come on you want to be the biggest bank in SEA but the app you make works terrible probably the most annoying app on my phone right now. Hate this so much and I hate the fact that I can’t change banks right now. Don’t worry I’ll change my bank immediately when I get the chance.,2021-11-10 06:41:52,-1
1,World Class Digital Banking Experience? : The statement “deliver world class banking experience” is laughable.This app is frustrating especially when and after the IT guys are doing/ are done with their “maintenance”. Sometimes the feeling is like winning the lottery if everything went smoothly.Numerous times (no joke no exaggeration) have encountered problems where after just 3 or 4 seconds of logging in a digibank Alert will pop-up saying the session has time-out for my security & to login again. Even after dozens of time trying the same thing happened!!!,2021-11-23 18:14:05,-1
5,语言 : 如何设置成华语啊,2020-01-24 09:49:06,1
5,POSB/DBS deserves a lot of kudos : I have done business with almost every bank in SG and POSB/DBS by far has the best customer experience. Great customer service and internet and mobile banking experience. None of the other banking apps are comparable to the quality of this app. I also like how the phishing warnings are seamlessly added to the app to warn people of potential phishing scams. Good job DBS!,2022-11-11 20:55:30,1
5,Felicia the dbs hot line service lady is very helpful👍👍 : I want to submit some online form but no idea why the form was not enabled on the dbs website. After call the dbs hotline it’s solved with the help from Felicia the hotline service lady. Felicia is very patient and helpful. She guides me step by step for the setup of the digitoken and eventually the website form is enabled. Thanks for the help Felicia.🙏,2024-03-25 06:15:18,1
4,各位大神 : 请问大师 这个应用怎么调成中文？,2020-07-08 09:58:42,1
5,Easy to use :) : Fabulous ease of use for local or overseas transfers payments and updates. Chat box a little useless and still easier to call the bank hotline for certain issues but this app does most of the stuff I need month-to-month with great ease. Thank you!,2020-11-11 02:54:04,1
2,App does not always work. Most times it just stay at its logo page : When using this and Dbs App many times it just stay on the main logo and doesn’t move hence can’t carry out transactions. Turn off and on phone. Deleted and download App a few times still same problem since many weeks ago. Currently Using iPhone 8plus and iOS 14.4. Noticed Problem probably started about the time of the last 2nd or 3rd IOS update. Not sure when this App was last updated. Anyway pls sort this out.,2021-02-20 05:21:50,-1
1,Tilt : This is my first time writing a review on an app store. Nothing came close to actually prompt me into writing a review but this app is certainly something.For heaven sake I had to login to my account more than 3 times because of your “session timeout” 10 seconds into your app. Not to mention how annoying typing on the login preface is. Mind you I’m using the latest update. If I have to keep doing this everytime I need to access my bank account I would prefer to use other convenient means. Please get this check.,2021-11-17 14:33:32,-1
1,Was awesome at first really crappy since a year ago : My fav app hasnt been functioning. Takes a long time to log me in impossible to transfer money or anything of that sort. I even changed my phone from iPhone10 to iPhone13 thinking it was my old phone causing the issue but no… the problem persists even after multiple deletion and re-installation. If its too hard might just move my money to UOB or OCBC. It’s embarrassing when you gotta wait 5mins to make a simple paynow transfer at a merchant with a long queue behind you ☹️ .,2022-07-21 11:11:47,-1
4,Great app but need improvements : It’s A Great app and very convenient. Posb can improve few things: in CC section if you to in one cc details and then want to see other one you have to come all the way out to home then click on cc to expand and select next one. Surely can reduce number of taps and simplify it. Similarly there is scope to reduce taps on other account screens.,2021-08-07 12:27:33,1
4,Fulfils banking needs : Great app that fulfils most of my banking needs. Smooth with decent amount of customisation available. Need to work on the digiPortfolio functionality though - app keeps quitting when attempting to navigate through that.21/09: impossible to report bugs so have to resort to this - app quits when when trying to sync to findex.,2023-09-21 12:29:35,1
2,Kept hanging : Was a user friendly app until it hang my entire phone. I can’t even reset my phone. Made me panic and wonder what went wrong as I was doing transfer. Happened twice already. And I don’t even know if the trf went through. I even tried resetting my mobile by pressing the home and on/off keys. But it doesn’t even blink! Then the app itself auto exit. This is scary! Not reliable! I’m avoiding using it as much as I can from now.,2021-05-11 09:19:07,-1
4,Please mute the friggin bank transfer / payment sound when the phone is on mute!!! : 1. Please mute the friggin bank transfer / payment sound when the phone is on mute!!!It is so awkward when people are in a silent room or the library and you had to do a payment.2. Why is the loading times for the app is so slow until i had to quit the app to load???,2021-03-26 08:47:20,1
5,App showing session timeout immediately after login : I updated my app to latest version and once I login and it is displaying session timeout and asking to relogin After I relogin getting same error and looping same process and I cannot able to perform any actions.,2021-10-10 15:19:13,1
1,Phone becomes unresponsive after using the app : As mentioned by a lot of users here the usage of the app causes the phone to heat up so quickly and the whole phone becomes unresponsive. This happens even after using the app for only less than a minute. As someone who makes use of the digibank services quite frequently it is very inconvenient for me to keep restarting my phone after each transaction. I sincerely hope the developers would do something about this.,2021-08-20 13:27:13,-1
1,App cannot load and stuck at loading screen : Before update to 5.02 cannot get pass loading screen. Complain through many channel no positive responds. Customer service channel no help at all.After 5.02 still same problem. Feels like POSB not taking customers seriously extremely disappointed. Unable to use ibanking app for a few weeks already. My only way to access ibanking account also requires “authentication” from app. Now app cannot use I am totally stuck. Feels like switching to other more capable banks.,2020-12-30 14:55:46,-1
3,3/5 : This app used to be great it’s easy to navigate and has features to give you insights on your finances. PayNow also easy to use. But the app has been crashing multiple times. Log in for one second -> error message that session has times out -> logged out. And repeat ad nauseam. No point having good features when I can’t even manage to stay logged in..,2021-11-11 11:52:07,-1
3,App stuck at opening logo : After the most recent update (Jan 2021) the app is still stuck at the opening logo and would require the user to kill the app using the app switcher and then reopen for it to load properly only the 2nd time onwards. And after some time or later in the day the same thing has to be done again.This issue happens on many others’ phones as well. Kindly fix it ASAP,2021-01-26 08:13:58,-1
5,Payment  control : The payment control allow to have a full control of your credit /debit card in which no bank offer such features in Singapore bank yet .,2022-06-14 14:59:11,1
4,PayNow Contact List : Since IOS 14 there has been a bug with PayNow contact list page. When a contact name is typed in search bar the search bar ovelaps with the contacts below making it unable to select the top 2 contacts shown on the list. This needs a fix asap !,2022-03-03 15:41:05,1
3,Feedback suggestion : Please let us set the default source of funds in our profile and remember it. And don’t switch it each time we select another account to do a paynow transfer. E.g every time we login it will always go back to the default account we set in profile not the last account we used to do a transfer,2023-08-09 09:39:46,-1
5,Transaction History Time Range : Currently users can only view transaction history of the past 6 months (max). It would be more helpful to allow viewing up to 12 months back.,2021-10-23 10:51:10,1
5,Fantastic app for my favourite bank. : I have not had any major issues from the time I’ve started using this app. Love how it’s a one stop one solution for all my banking needs which money other banks actually haven’t really tried to implement. Good job POSB. 👍🏽👍🏽,2021-07-10 07:12:31,1
5,POSB app page Standstill : This happens almost every time after IOS has been updated . Don’t have this issue since last year where it was working fine for me last few years,2021-02-11 03:05:53,1
1,Blood from ears : Some clown on the developer / ux team insists of having the alert chime PING when we send monet despite the visual being more than adequate. The result - a screeching sound that harms the eardrums way above safe and acceptable levels. It has no threshold - cannot be disabled and is just loud for the sake of it. it’s also obtrusive - everyone gets to hear that one is doing banking.I recorded the Decibel levels on my Apple Watch and it Alerts a warning. Now imagine how this feels inside the ear?!? This is not just irresponsible - it’s dangerous and needs to be addressed!,2021-03-15 03:36:34,-1
2,Frequently facing issues loggin in. : Service not available issue occurring more frequently. Sometimes even after login  immediately getting time out errors. Some other times it throw error saying too many times using wrong pin and ask to reset PIN where only Face ID was used to login. Worst experience of using the world’s best digital bank app. Cannot even support the small SG customer base.,2021-11-23 06:53:05,-1
5,Best banking app for credit card : I love the added layers to lock different type of transactions making it easy to prevent unauthorised one!  I am hoping other bank card has them too!,2024-03-22 01:56:45,1
1,Cards : Please update back on the CARDS section update to the previous version. Its making me  confuse on the pending thing previous version was easy for me to track down my expenses. With the new version it get so confusing. Please please remove the pending thingy i prefer the previous version where i can easily track down my expenses! Prefer the previous version where it display your expenses accordingly without confusing with the pending thing.,2021-06-09 19:51:48,-1
3,Please relook the functions and UX! : Not sure what’s happened but it’s almost impossible to login to the app now... it just hangs and shows the main page for a very long time unlike before. Even after logging off and restarting my phone it takes forever. OTP sent to email address? Not sure what’s happened. Pls improve the UX. Previously it was so much better more seamless to use.,2021-02-28 03:48:36,-1
2,Causing iPhone 12 Pro temp to go up : Not sure is that only me or anyone else facing the same problem... my new iPhone 12 Pro Max can become very hot when using this app... never happen to my other iPhone before. Was advice my apple help line to delete and re-install but still having the same problem. So far this is the only app that cause my phone to become very hot... hopefully this can be resolve soon with some coming update..,2020-12-24 03:31:23,-1
1,App Closes Automatically : When I try login to internet banking on my laptop/PC there will be a notification on my phone to authorize the login. However when I press on the notification the POSB app will open and close automatically and then I cannot login on my laptop/PC. I have restarted the app a few times did hard reset of the phone a few times and kept the app updated to the latest version. But the same issue occurs. Please look into this software bug. Thank you.,2020-08-02 10:50:01,-1
2,Keep Asking for feedback : I am an avid user of the app to track all my expenses. However every time i want log out the app keep asking me to provide them feedbacks and rating. Every.... single... time.. to me it’s unnecessary and i’ll just skip the rating portion and close the app. Why in i convenience? I understand that we all want the best out of the app through user rating but asking for the rating/feedback every time can be annoying.,2020-11-13 02:38:51,-1
5,语言 : 功能是很好用 如果有中文就更好了,2023-01-29 05:42:22,1
3,Easy to use but bugs in starting up : The app is intuitive and easy to use however a concern would be starting up the app especially after the latest IOS update. Frequent need to refresh and restart the app to do online transactions which can be annoying. Especially when immediate payment is required.,2021-02-21 14:33:34,-1
2,technical issue : i have trouble getting ibanking done as the app kept disconnecting me from wifi usage. I had thought it is my wifi issue but i had no issue using other apps and even watch netflix smoothly without distruption. However whenever i need to get money wired over app will crash and state that app is under maintenance or no transanction could be made thats when i realize my wifi will be affected,2021-02-06 09:06:00,-1
5,Recently app is lagging : Been having logging and transaction issues for the past few months took a long time to either log in or process transferred.,2021-10-01 00:31:53,1
1,login browser : Why do you need to change when things are doing fine and well in the past?? Your new keyboard is not interactive at all i kept missing out the inputs even though i have keyed in. 3 times telling me my user and password is incorrect. This definitely did not happen before and is due to your new keyboard. Please don't change for the sake of changing you are frustrating your customers.,2021-12-14 01:34:16,-1
5,POSB Digibank Handy Master : I have been using POSB digibank mobile application which gives enchanting experience to complete all my banking needs with ease. Great Tool from gracious POSB IT Team. May the Lord Bless you to attain success in all your ventures. Take care and Stay blessed All is well.,2022-07-19 06:07:04,1
5,App not responsive : My App is not responsive. Cannot open the App without having to delete and re upload again. Used to like the App but now I am sceptical about using it. Can fix the bug please?,2021-02-04 08:19:36,1
5,Great app : User friendly with almost everything can be done using the app instead of having to go to website,2022-12-20 00:14:57,1
2,PayNow - This service isn’t available right now. : After the update keep facing the error This service isn’t available right now. Now is 7am plus in the morning how can the service not available on a weekday.There shouldn’t be any maintenance during this period. I have tried for 2 days.Also sometimes after transfer of money the app crashed. Need to relogin to check if the transaction has crossed.,2019-11-04 23:42:27,-1
3,Issues : First of this app takes too much space I'm not even too sure why. Secondly my music would stop when opening the app and trying to resume playing music would be stopped as soon as I go back to the app. Other than that there are no bugs that I am experiencing,2022-09-01 01:29:32,-1
1,Lousy bank app just beware : Apps are always slow and laggy. When negative feedback is given the system will always deflect them by sending an error message stating that there’s some technical glitch going on. This message won’t appear when the user gives good ratings. Clearly shows that the people behind this app system have no commitment to keep your account secure safe and reliable.,2023-10-15 03:35:17,-1

I have to un-install EVERY single time you have updates to the app and I unable to login. I am using the latest iOS on iPhone 7+ don’t give me crap about old phones or whatsoever.

1,Problematic : Ever since the major update convenience isn’t a thing about this app. Logging in takes ages sometimes it crashes when logging in and when i do i’m already at the age of retirement.When i check my transaction history same thing. Loading takes forever and sometimes it crashes.Where is the old POSB app? I miss that so much. The simplicity the efficiency the straightforward no hooplah. Bring back the old posb codes not this hot pile of garbage.,2020-08-28 20:42:44,-1
5,Face ID issue : I have problem with Face ID to unlock POSB digibank apps. I don’t know maybe because of security reasons. Otherwise it’s very good apps to use in Singapore and overseas after updating phone number. Thank you.,2021-08-04 00:51:38,1
1,App doesn’t work almost all the time : App doesn’t work many features don’t show single information just a msg sorry we are having issue. This is especially true when it is weekend or late evening till morning. Sometimes login page says sorry we are facing heavy traffic try logging after sometime. What is this?

1,App causing phone to heat up : I noticed that this version after using for like 5 minutes the phone starts getting hot very fast.Initially I thought this was caused by another app as.

5,Full of bugs : Crashes after every update and cannot even use the Face ID to log in. One of the most prominent bank in Singapore but with lack lustre online app services. Disappointed. Uninstalled.,2020-02-28 11:07:25,1
1,Overly protective and too amateurish : Each time when I log in it prompts me to set up a digital token and the authentication is from email and sms. It’s a chore and the app developers aren’t giving any consideration on this matter. Better to use the DBS app as its more faster to log in.It’s good to be protective but please understand the user’s point of view. In case of need to check the balance or use the app on an urgent basis?,2023-05-22 14:11:14,-1

5,Having problem using the apps : Always stuck at the POSB logo screen and didn’t change into the main where I need to use the digital token on time. I’m using IOS 14.2 vision. Please look into it. Thanks.,2020-12-09 10:04:50,1
3,iPhone 8 Compatibility Issues : I am a iPhone 8 user and I have been experiencing issues entering the POSB and DBS app and I heard that a friend of mine also an iP8 user has been experiencing the same issue for some time now.

4,POSB digibank review : It makes transferring a breeze. The application is easy to use. However it can be improved by putting tutorial on how to use the application on the login page. New users may not know how to setup and manage their accounts.,2020-06-04 03:26:58,1

Seriously have to check transactions everytime I use the app.,2022-11-06 13:42:33,-1
3,Currency exchange  feature request : It will be nice if DBS supports preset currency exchange. Like a pre-order of exchanging $1000 sgd to aud if a certain exchange rate is offered.

1,Need More ATMs at Seletar Mall : POSB branch at Seletar Mall has been closed sometime last year 2020. Leaving behind ONE  (1) and only ATM machine at basement NTUC.  Always long long queue during weekends. Machine at NTUC is also placed at a small and congested space. Machine also cannot perform book updating. Also can only draw out $50 notes not small denomination notes. Could  POSB/DBS look into this?  Could personnel find another location and place a few more machines at Seletar Mall?  Thanks.,2021-02-27 10:18:30,-1
1,Have to get a physical token to activate the digital one : Yup was advised by DBS call Center after going through days of waiting for them to fix the app glitch. Now the only solution is to do the above cuz apparently the SMS pin is also not working. Why keep updating and changing the app if basic functions can’t even stay in working conditions? Really frustrating .... Stop ‘improving’ this app unnecessarily please if it’s working fine!,2019-12-16 13:25:25,-1

1,Keep prompting me to set up digital token : The app prompted me to set up digital token many times on the same phone.  I just completed setting it up at 8.30pm today. When I tried to login at 9.30pm it prompted me again. I have to go through the same steps again. Otherwise I can only log off. Terrible service. I don’t have this problem with Ocbc & Citibank app,2023-05-12 13:37:46,-1
4,Push notification : Didn’t receive push notification.,2023-10-16 23:29:33,1
1,Mixed : Occasionally have reliability issues like pre mature time outs.  Some aspects could improve like ease of adding payees or moving across screens within the payments function.

1,CANNOT OPEN APP : App is very unreliable as it can only be used at rare times. Most of the time it remain stuck on the white screen or screen with the dbs logo. Not only am i unable to use ibanking through my phone im also unable to use ibanking through laptop anyway as it requires me to authenticate through digital token on my phone which cant be done since the app cant even be opened. Called customer service last year october and they say they cannot do anything to help and this happens to some and that they will try to fix the problem soon. Well....its april 2021 alr.....so???Used to use dbs as my main acct but have switch to ocbc since this happened. :/,2021-04-06 16:49:37,-1

1,Face ID login fails whenever iOS updates : Face ID login does not work on iOS 16.1. Developer does not respond to any feedback on this.

1,Ridiculous control limits on payments to other banks : Dbs controls how much you transfer / make payments to other banks in a single transaction in the name of security - but this can also be overcome via multiple consecutive transactions in the same day.

3,Annoying session expiry. : Please stop asking people to extend if you have coded sessions to quickly expire it is extremely annoying and redundant. Also please stop asking me for feedback on every session logout. I am not your telemetry resource.,2023-04-24 10:14:55,-1

2,Biometric login | Quick peek gone aft update? : Have always lauded TouchID login as a key game changer to friends as it really speeds up the process and makes PayNow / Scan to Pay a breeze (rest of waiting time mostly on sending and receiving of transaction status).It was mysteriously gone after an app update. After having read the reviews realised FaceID is not supported as well.Please make biometric login a priority as this is key to a good / secure mobile banking app.*balance Quick peek unfortunately has also been missing after my last update.*If implementing Face ID in a future update perhaps would be a good time to do a ‘iOS12’ styled version as well. To fine tune critical features and fix bugs in existing ones.A future feature request would be to be able to streamline e interface further and allow user to customise e home screen to hide lesser used functions and bring most common ones forward.OCBC’s interface is nice to look at but TouchID login process is limited and app crashes time to time upon conducting transactions.Hope POSB’s versions moves forward at a steady and measured pace. To add stuff and improve w each iteration w/o breaking any existing features*,2018-09-26 09:48:20,-1
4,POSB digibank : Well. After the latest update things really do seem smoother. However when making payments to other bank's credit card it becomes tricky. Because the banks logos do not appear. Instead a large yellow dot with the letter L in the center appears as the logo. And all the other credit cards will have that same logo. So stupid!So every time I make a credit card payment to say UOB I have to remember my credit card number. Because there's this yellow logo and all the other credit cards have the same yellow logo with the letter L. Surely DBS can do better. Thank you.,2016-12-07 23:15:56,1
4,lagging behind other banks : Other banks provide better login methods (faster and uses good FaceID). POSB/DBS need to catch up. Heard a new app is coming hope key functions such as amount used on credit card will be there (instead of having to manually available limit minus from the total limit to calculate it. You should also always display pending transactions (citibank and UOB are already doing it - don’t understand why the “best” bank in singapore doesn’t have any of these functions. Was disappointed when I tried to find any of these key features.,2019-07-19 01:06:40,1
4,Great Improvement from previous App but... : Now it's a lot more interactive with nice clean layout with convenient access to what you want. With Touch ID it's much easier to log in. Regarding this issue when I close the app using the home button and return back to the app via home screen or multi task window there's no verification with Touch ID again that's a security compromise. It would be better if there's always a request for Touch ID. When popping in and out of the app.,2016-03-15 16:52:23,1
3,Great features some broken : Paynow is fantastic. A lot of services are at my fingertips which makes life a lot easier. But one thing that has been broken for a while on the iOS version is the phonebook search in PayNow. Typing a friend's name doesn't bring up a filtered drop down for me to select from. It's just completely broken. Copy pasting a phone number ends up being truncated too. So in the end I always have to manually key in phone numbers to make a transfer. Please fix it soon it's not that hard guys!,2019-03-21 00:16:52,-1
3,Surprise : I've been taking for granted that whatever I see from this app (whether it's è slide & hold or login view) how much balance I have in my account. When I saw the digits literally not moving after I spent some money I went to the ATM machine to check and my balance was really different from what I saw on the app. Yes it was a surprise for me to realize the digits I've been seeing is not updated at all for quite some time. Please help fix this issue. I love using this app cuz it's v useful and user-friendly. I would like to give it 5 stars again.,2016-10-20 22:29:51,-1
2,Great... if i can even login : I doubt the effectiveness of this app. Feature-set Looks good in theory but none of it matters if I can’t even login. I reset myPassword at least twice in a row the SMS notifications was beserk when i was setting up ibanking the app showed me a ‘unsuccessful setup’ status & then logged me in. Seriously sketchy... i am using the latest iOS 13.1 but i was able to login on the laptop but not mobile phone.. sketttchyyyyy i will wanna take screenshots of all my actions/transactions now. I would be ‘pro cryptocurrency just for this but LOL it’s all haywire correct anot???,2019-11-01 12:48:14,-1
1,Slow : Before the update  everything was so smooth and neat  it’s basically zero effort be it transaction wise as well as checking of balance and all However after the update  checking of balance was slow and all  everything requires SMS Pin and all  it really slowed down the whole process by a lot as it was once easily done with fingerprint scanning Besides the whole SMS pin problem  sometimes it showed incorrect pin even though it was the right one  and i had to leave the app first  then enter back the app to be able to access to the page that i wantYou see  maybe instead of trying to improve useless stuffs  what not just bring back the old one which was smooth and fast  I feel that for us users  nothing beats quick and efficiency  we just need our stuffs quick  and not a slow process like this It’s really quite disappointing as i once liked the app a lot and introduced it to a lot of my friends,2019-02-22 03:01:39,-1
1,History for overseas transfer : Have u just updated again the app without proper notifications for us to update in iTunes? This is the second time I've experienced an update without any details. Previously when I do transfer I could check it out in the history in which I have another box there to select the transaction type which is for overseas transfer. Now I could only see the account type and the latter has just disappeared. It very efficient last time since you would see if it's completed or submitted with regards to your status. Please do the update and put it back Thanks,2016-08-01 01:15:52,-1
1,Very dissapointing : App often crash. Upon signing in and after doing the setting for face log in and peek balance. Over some time all those settings will go default. It is very frustrating. No point of implementing these features when it doesn't work properly. Have been facing this issue quite some time.At times after keying in correct details to log in pop out box stating digital token was set wrongly and need to re install app. Even the homepage of the app is flickering. What is going on here POSB? Please do somthing about all these issue. it is really dissappointing thinking that this app could ease daily use.,2019-04-15 22:57:53,-1
5,Singaporeans complain too much : I think this is a great app with a well-designed and user friendly interface far better than the one that came before it. It lets me review and transfer funds with relative ease. I don't know why so many Singaporeans take all these things for granted; but kudos to the devs who made this app thank you!,2017-07-04 02:31:59,1
1,Great interface but zero usage practicality : The interface overshadows the practicality of the app usage. Been having multiple issues with Digital Token Authentication and I’m not the only one facing this problem. Even after following the live agent’s suggestions of deleting the app and reinstalling it again it doesn’t work. Then they had to manually delete the digital token on their end (so that I can set it up again) I thought that there would be hope but the authentication STILL doesn’t work. Please POSB for the love of your neighbours fix this terrible and irritating bug.,2019-08-16 12:16:13,-1
1,What’s the point? : Really. What’s the point of the app when it does not allow you to register? Downloaded the app. Tried registering. Put in my card numbers etc. And app says service is not available try again later. Sure. Tried again later. Still didn’t work. Tried later again. Again doesn’t work. Basically I cannot register. So brings me back to my point; what’s the point of this utterly useless app when you can’t use it? And it’s a banking app. Does not inspire confidence with the banks digital initiatives if they can’t get one simple basic app right.Utterly useless.,2017-11-29 05:20:27,-1
4,Nice improved app but need tweaking : Its a nice refreshing app but first thing i noticed is the font and numbers are too small in the balance amount.It would also be nice if we can re-arrange the display order in our displayed account page like the OCBC apps offer so that the more frequently used account can be shifted to the top of the page and we dont have to scroll down the page.,2016-03-16 01:40:51,1
1,Connectivity Issue : I could not even open the app. Once the app loads an alert pops up which states “Digibank Alert. Unable to verify you internet connectivity” funny thing is that the background promotion news loads perfectly and this seems to be the only app in my phone that does not work. Ps I I have connected via mobile data and home wifi plus I have uninstalled and reinstalled several times however the issue is still there and it’s been going on for days! Please fix this issue! Such an inconvenience.,2019-03-12 13:17:47,-1
5,Where did Touch ID login go? : I had thought that DBS/POSB has finally started getting digital right with their online and app efforts but this new release is pretty disappointing. Why have you removed the Touch ID login feature? That really make your app a breeze to use and now you've gone and ruined the experience.,2017-09-05 13:54:49,1
5,Love the simple design in Financial Plan : I have been using POSB app for my daily purpose and the most advanced feature I liked the most is Financial Plan. They designed to make it more simple and very outstanding. User interface and experience are the key to success. Keep it up guys you can do it better. #BestBankInWorld,2019-08-15 12:41:15,1
1,App installed but nowhere to be found : Zero stars for this horrible appWas forced to download this app because the pervious POSB app stopped working. Even with all the bad reviews I had to download this to use IB but after clicking download the app was not seen on my phone. Tried to click download again and same thing happened. If your newest app is not ready to be used by clients why do you have to close the previous POSB IB app? This is supposed to be more convenient for clients but it just angers us? Perhaps you should attempt to use this app and ENSURE it works BEFORE releasing it.,2016-07-14 02:16:05,-1
5,Performance Improvement Feedback : Thank you for continuously making progress for a quicker and effortless ibanking.  Perhaps the next one that should be look into is the balance quick peek and face ID.   After my upgrade to iOS 12.2 i’ve to go login with userid and password the ancient way.,2019-04-14 01:53:51,1
5,Great Improvement! : I'm really impressed with the app. It is much easier to use as compared to the old mBanking app which was too cluttered. Now i'm able to check my balance and transfer funds to other accounts on my phone!,2016-03-14 22:30:43,1
1,Digital Token isn’t working?! : Want to do some online banking and I have to authenticate via the app but I keep getting the pop up to enable digital token and nothing happens even though I’ve already registered the physical token? I cannot even generate an OTP on the app because it just prompts me to login and takes me to the homepage and there’s no digital token button anywhere on the interface once you’re logged in. I don’t have the option of getting an OTP through SMS or using the physical token as well. Very frustrating!,2019-08-15 03:16:45,-1
1,Crash : I am using face ID so i can’t key wrong password but still prompt me wrong PW and need to delete the whole app and reinstall again this happens every 2days or so since I updated the key token update thing.. this has been on going i have to delete and reinstall even i know and 100% sure that i have the correct password..this has been very inconvenient cause i have accounts that I transfer money in and out from time to time.please help to check why is this happening,2019-04-23 01:50:46,-1
1,语言 : 软件已经出中文了。更新后完全没看见在哪里有中文的。,2019-09-04 05:49:37,-1
1,Great app. Nice waiting game : This is a great app that lags the moment the you open it. After a few seconds you can start to log in and thereafter you will have to wait because this bank have so many customers. You have to understand that the app not only serves you but others too. So if you can't log in please try again even though other banks do it better. At POSB waiting is better. If not why would you use it instead of going down to the dbs/posb ATMs right?,2019-10-29 11:27:56,-1
4,Satisfied but suggestion! : Very satisfying experience in the app. The only feature I wish the app provide is being able to check Transaction history for each payee or a particular person that I have transferred in stead of looking back inside the long list of every transactions.,2019-02-15 13:44:58,1
5,Biometric issues was resolved with the latest updates : The biometric issues were fixed and the app is working now very good. I feel much much better as compared to previous versions.,2019-10-01 03:14:18,1
1,New UI is bad : Still prefer the previous UI. Seems that you guys are changing the app for the sake of changing.   Poor layout.  Font is too thin text is too small hard to read.  Not everyone has a 7 inch screen !Had to jump through hoops to find a service.  Where is the card fee waiver ?  It's hidden in the chat bot and had to launch a browser to login again ?? and how do I authenticate when I am in the POSB's app browser ???What's with the insurance ad on the main page?,2019-08-25 02:05:41,-1
5,A MASSIVE improvement!!! : I don’t usually write reviews for bank apps but I’ve been frustrated with posb digibank’s app for too long.. Until today’s update. Omg it’s so fast and intuitive. It’s everything a modern bank app should be. Keep improving please I am LOVING this change!! 5 stars!,2019-08-19 16:52:31,1
5,Lo & behold : Finally an app that's thousand times better than the original. Really excited by the work of the IT team and really glad at the work you guys have been doing. Kuddos to those who worked to create this wonderful and interactive app! Cheers!,2016-03-24 04:08:38,1
3,Great idea but needs improvements : The balance peeking is useful however that also means other people can gain access to my balance info whenever I hand then my phone there should be a simple and fast verification to peek the balance like making use of the touch ID.Touch ID can also be used to replace the token for various transactions.Great app overall,2016-04-04 19:50:40,-1
5,FaceID & Peek Features are in the Personal Settings ! : Those of you using iOS12.1 - both FaceID and Peek features can be found under Settings > Personal Change (1st item in the menu) ! For those who gave poor ratings pls check again.,2018-11-28 11:47:14,1
1,Unstable and a downgrade from previous version.. : Highly unstable after updates. login page timed out for no reason -I just launched the app. Multiple service not available even though it’s touchid. Interface not user friendly as well I realised. Find it takes a while to find what I’m looking for. The previous version I was less familiar but figured out intuitively where I could find things. The design is really a downgrade as well.,2019-08-22 14:37:03,-1
5,Karthik marupaka : It’s really good app for all the workers here from India or Bangladesh or etc coz easy to send money to our families it’s good supporting app all off us please download all you to understand new things in dbs and posb we support them they will support us more,2018-09-08 13:23:12,1
1,Unfriendly User Interface : 1. Interface not optimized to iPhone 8plus. Black bars on top and bottom of screen makes the interface look outdated.2. Functionalities are not as clearly apparent as previous version.3. Failed digital token authentification when trying to make payments on line. Button to press does not appear in phone app. No other options for one time OTP generation to make payments.Very disappointed with update. Please rectify soon.,2019-08-24 23:07:25,-1
1,can i use the old version? : i tried to pay other banks credit card once first transaction was done i clicked make another payment app crashed ok fine i relogin again and clocked transfer & pay and chose pay other banks again then crash again crashed few times and the app cannot use anymore i reinstalled twice still the same the app just cannot use anymore i clicked Login and nth happen..,2016-07-04 14:58:06,-1
1,Worst banking App : DBS just can’t get this app to do the most important thing which is to allow to login to your account when you are on a desktop or laptop the digital token which was used to be there although never worked allows you to generate manual OTP and with the most recent update they completely remove this feature and I can’t login to my DBS account this is such a simple thing and they simply can’t do it right!,2019-08-15 05:25:49,-1
2,"welcoming change but : we do not need a huge banner that takes up half of screen space every time we log in saying ""welcome to digibank"" that's poor design.why did you remove the rubber banding effect when you scroll? it's a system wide feature of iOS and disabling it only makes your application inconsistent with other iOS apps.when I type in the SMS secure pin why do I need to close the keyboard just because the submit button is hidden behind it? that's poor design. it should be placed on the TOP right hand corner of the token window.please look at how impressive Apps from other countries especially the US are. Singapore apps pale in comparison",2016-03-16 04:10:12,-1
5,The new interface is pretty : The new interface is pleasant for use. As compared to other banks the digital functions really can perform most of the transactions and they are seamlessly done.,2019-08-26 14:52:17,1
1,Very Bad App and unstable at time : Had installed app on a few occasions after every attempt to synchronised my ID & Pin  after a few days it will not allow me to log in citing digi token setup failed instantly ... IT must do something about it before more will turn to other user friendly Banking App 。Please trace my past records how many time is installed and re-instal again . Before your upgrade all was well  but after that all was a mess,2019-07-20 21:27:34,-1
2,App cannot use : I been using this app for so long. After I update the app and when I want to use it. It’s keep prompting that my phone not connected to internet..?? Using wifi and even I off and on my phone many times it’s still the same... And it’s not convenient for me to always use my laptop to check my account and transfer..,2019-03-19 08:36:42,-1
1,App keeps saying unable to verify internet connectivity : Cannot log-in in app keeps saying unable to verify internet connectivity even if all other apps work. Settings checked and Data is on for this app but still the same problem. Uninstalled & installed still the same. Now cannot authenticate transactions because I cannot log-in in app so digital token cannot work. This is frustrating!,2019-03-01 08:58:36,-1
5,Can’t even login : After the latest update the app cant even allow me to log in keep receiving the error message Page timeout.,2019-06-16 04:55:59,1
3,Buggy Lagging : Before update things will smooth.. from logging in to making transactions will a breeze.. now the app take quite a while to login for iphone SE took long to process the login and sometimes double login try.. it also look very buggy.. plz do something about it...,2019-02-28 23:43:34,-1
1,Irritating .....old app is better than current app : This app is really wasting my time.. When I tap login on my iPhone 6+.. It's not even responds.. No error nothing.. When I see in AppStore there is no updated app... They just added few useful functionalities like Touch ID n quick balance .. But services are always down...what's the point to add new functions which cannot maintain.. Please come up with better quality app with new UX,2016-06-16 02:23:02,-1
4,Request for extra features : The app is currently nice enough. But of course it can still be further improved.I would like to request two new features in the credit card statement listing:(1) Show the running total of posted payments in the Unbilled Transactions pageview(2) For transactions in overseas currencies show the foreign currency amount in the transaction entryNote that these two features are already available on the desktop webpage view of the same info.,2018-02-05 07:33:15,1
4,Option to request for a new cheque book : Please consider introducing on this App an option to request for a new cheque book to be delivered instead of having to call the branch or customer service. Thank you,2017-06-12 16:28:49,1
5,Love it!! : I really love how it helps to sort out my expenses with the new Financial GPS Tracker features. I finally get to ease my mind where my money goes to. No longer need additional app to manage my money.,2018-02-25 01:06:01,1
5,Really Nice : Compared with DBS UI this new DiGi UI is superb. No need to keep moving the page. Bit scary abt the UI looks not corp style but the process is awesome. Try to change the WEB UI also like this. The new web ui is really F'Off...,2016-03-14 23:52:12,1
1,Digital token authentication is a fail : Hi POSB I have failed to authenticate my online session through the app’s digital token feature. I didn’t even receive any notification on my app and the amazing design means I have to wait for the countdown on the website to finish before I can do anything about it. Please fix this because if I cannot use the digital token authentication feature then I cannot use POSB online banking.,2019-01-04 10:49:39,-1
4,Need an update! : Always relied on Touch ID for easier login before I switched my phone. Now it’s a hassle to manually type in everything again. Could Face ID be incorporated into the app as soon as possible please?,2018-10-31 13:12:27,1
5,Works well : I got no idea what happened to the other customers about this app problem but this just works for me 100%.,2016-07-15 10:47:12,1
5,Simple and easy to use : Simple and easy to use. I think the new feature to see my full account with just a 1 pin login is very cool,2016-12-05 12:57:28,1
3,Activate Overseas Usage of Card : Tried this using both POSB and DBS app. Either I can't agree to the terms and conditions because number pad is blocking (no way to remove the number pad after keying in dates)(DBS app) or I can't limit the usage for a period of time (POSB app) T.THave to end up using the computer.,2016-05-14 11:56:22,-1
1,Face ID does not work : Face ID will succeed but the result from the app is “service not available right now.” If try to login through the normal way will be prompted with timed out error. Every single time. Unable to disable Face ID either; it will give the same message as when you try to login with Face ID. Since the latest update until now still no fix for this.,2019-09-16 02:32:33,-1
3,What happened? : The 'slide and hold' is gone?? Now i need to login in order to look at my bank acc bal. The touch id is gone too! I've seen your ads everywhere - isn't the whole unique selling point of your app the 'slide and hold' and touch id? What happened to them? Pls fix this,2016-08-27 06:06:49,-1
2,Looks better but usability falls short of old app : The old app doesn't look as good but it's much more user friendly. Buttons are big short cuts are faster. The informational flow is also more logical. Now we have menus and all which gives u a lot more functions bt the steps to get to each function is a lot more!,2016-03-30 07:54:56,-1
1,I DONT KNOW WHETHER ANYONE ELSE HAVE THIS SAME PROBLEM : My peek balance is not even on the application itself the fact that after the update it totally disappeared. Well for me its so good at first then it disappeared right after update. What just happened it’s been months i tried to find the setting and all but theres nothing. Please fix this! Hope you read this and somewhat response to it. Thanks~,2017-12-25 22:25:27,-1
5,Nice design : Really brings life to the app. Maybe those people that give those review are too rich and wants boring old ui. 10/10 devs good job for this update,2019-08-24 23:21:29,1
1,Motion sickness after use : The new update is not user friendly. Used to see everything in one screen but now need more steps to find different account or credit card balances etc; so cumbersome. Font size too big and interface does not fit phone screen properly (how to change font size?). Options are not well laid out.,2019-08-15 15:19:49,-1
2,Please revert back to the old interface : The version before the update was much more user friendly. This new update does not fit my screen and the log in page itself when typing in my name and passcode looks like an iPhone 4 keyboard. App internally was hard to navigate as well.,2019-08-14 11:07:56,-1
1,Unable to access Digital Token : Was told to register for Digital Token so that it’ll be more convenient. But now the Digital Token cannot even be accessed at all. Spoke to Customer Service and was told that this is a common issue and I have to close and reopen the app several times for it to work. Been there and done that but to no avail.Seriously solve this issue so that I can do transactions...,2019-01-30 07:56:37,-1
3,App freezes : Ever since the latest update when I want to make a transfer to my saved contacts the app freezes and force close itself. Please fix this issue because it’s frustrating. Using an iPhone 6S plus.,2019-01-06 02:20:08,-1
4,Massive improvement : Liked the new interface and functionality. Easy access to checking of balance.,2016-03-21 03:49:53,1
2,Digital Token is very unreliable : It takes a very long time for the Digital Token to respond until the Internet Banking website already expires. Authenticating just got stuck. Very unreliable. It should give the user to select SMS or hard token option when digital token is not working accordingly. It’s so frustrating.,2019-10-29 10:55:09,-1
5,In one word Fastneat and clean : New update is awesome !!! . Neat and clean design provide a refreshing feel. Performance  touch sensitivity and animation are good . This design update i am expecting since last year. Good job dbs.,2019-08-15 00:11:29,1

4,Touch ID/Face ID and Peek Balance : When I set the Touch ID/Face ID and Peek Balance after a while this setting will be back to default where I need to enter user name and password.This app is not stable and sometimes the perk balance will hang too.,2019-08-25 11:34:00,1
1,Worst update app : Updated app make me irritating setting I changed Face ID and peek balance after 1 hour all disappear and re do again and disappear again updated should be useful here make me irritating and worst update ever... please solve this problem otherwise I will cancel posb account and other bank account....My Apple Watch also doesn’t work,2019-08-23 18:57:12,-1
1,FingerPrint ID not working : It has been months since the fingerprint ID function has been down. It’s saddening to learn that the very feature that is supposed to be a norm is still not fixed after the app first launch. Can you guys look into this quickly? It has been down for months not weeks nor days. Months!,2019-10-27 12:09:59,-1
1,New Update got issue. Do not update!!! : Simply trying to compete with other banks on complicating the app and forgot all about being “easy to use”.Not easy to use and any new updates will have issues.Ever since the latest update I can no longer use my digital token and was asked to wait until 7am before I can perform any transactions.,2019-08-14 17:02:53,-1
5,Where is the Paynow option? : I don’t seems to find the paynow option now after the update,2018-12-01 21:54:08,1
1,Can’t set up digital token and app keeps saying the 6 digit pin from my physical token is invalid : This app isn’t worth 1 star. I can’t do anything with my accounts now not even checking transaction history since both digital and physical tokens didn’t work. SMS option to receive 1 time pin is also grayed out in new app. Why? I’m so frustrated now.,2019-09-01 06:44:51,-1

Goodness!!,2016-07-15 02:51:26,-1

2,Loss of Important Payee’s Names : Hi I would like to highlight the new update has caused important payee’s names to be lost.I hope relevant parties can see through this as it is extremely frustrating to be adding all the important payee’s details again (esp bank account) when it doesnt involve 1 but multiple payees. Thank you!,2019-04-26 17:22:51,-1
1,Totally incompatible with iOS 11 beta : Don't upgrade to iOS 11 beta if you want to use the posb digibank. Totally incompitable. And no one from Apple or posbank will do anything about it just saying that iOS 11  is a beta release so the app not working is unavoidable. To get it to work you will have to restore back to iOS 10. So don't understand what is this beta release for?,2017-08-19 00:36:21,-1
1,"App not working? : I'm no longer able to login with touch ID everytime I click login it doesn't prompt the touch ID login anymore and I have to login with my user ID and pin.

The worse is that online website always prompt digital token authentication before proceed to anything. Please do something about this error.,2019-08-15 00:49:20,-1
1,New Version - Rubbish : Automatically updated to this new version and cannot make any transaction! The digital token cannot be enabled without any notice or message.Login on website to make transactions and the mobile one will be forced logout. Urgent transactions need to be done by tonight and don’t know how!!!DBS you should publish new version with full testing!,2019-08-14 15:24:40,-1

1,Horrible : The bank launches a ver 3.0 app without considering the fact that the instructions on internet-banking (web browser) is still the old one.

PFFT (and wow you only allow 4 stars to be submitted) SCAM,2017-08-12 15:35:58,-1

App unable to launch on 24/11/2020 after update iOS ver to 14.2 and till now nothing been done after numerous call in. No follow up and nothing from you guys.

App keep showing “we are having trouble connecting”. And the bank service is just like they don want to provide any help.

3,Bug Fix & Feature Request : There seems to be an issue where I’d have to manually turn on and save the glance at Apple Watch feature in the app after doing so less than an hour ago. How do I get this fixed or is it a bug that everyone is facing? On that note would love to see us being able to perform transactions on the Apple Watch without the iPhone like perhaps a QR Code generated on the Apple Watch for the other person to scan and we can choose which way the transfer goes. This would immediately boost the user experience for those with the cellular Apple Watch.,2021-03-19 01:38:54,-1

1,Notification Spam : Notifications must be turn on for crucial banking services.However that doesn’t mean we consent to advertisements.,2020-08-11 12:22:57,-1

2,After update app still hangs : Super buggy app. Keeps hanging on loading pages can’t even log in to access my account and I end up having to do transactions on a computer.

2,No security code autofill : Please respect iOS’s security code autofill for the number keypad in the PIN input screen. Other banking apps adopt this and it makes login easier.,2019-10-21 02:56:03,-1
2,Could not find tool box : The tool box of the app is impossible to find.i tried to search online and the services this provides but still could not find it as I could not find it I could not change it to another language.This causes a inconvenience to me and I believe many people will be to so please place the tools box at a more visible and easier to find place and due to not being able change the language people who do not understand and  might make a mistake causing them to lose a money in the process and if it is not usable right now please do let people know that it does not exist and put it in in the future.,2019-10-12 04:27:37,-1

1,Belongs in the dark ages : This app is certainly a rara avis; it’s one of the last few remaining bank apps where you have to actually key in your username and PIN the primitive way. Every other bank has Face and/or Touch ID but no not POSB! How very retro. ‘Smart Nation’ indeed. Keep up the good work POSB you really are uniquely Singapore!,2019-05-29 04:41:04,-1
1,Latest Version 2.1.115 has a bug! : Tried to log in but got a digibank alert saying cannot verify my internet connection! Had no problems with previous versions! What’s happening?!!😣,2019-02-28 03:56:35,-1

1,Where is my 6 digit code : The new log in method never works. After pressing white key on IB token never received any 6 digit code on my phone. Can’t even change address. Worst experience.,2019-01-21 07:57:58,-1
1,Unable to get authenticated : Launched app after logging in to website portal. No sign of any authentication code. Hence not able to get authenticated to access my account via website portal. No way to get authenticated with my physical token when this digi option failed. POSB only gave one way of getting authentication once u sign up for this digi service. Would not recommend to sign up. Just keep using your token to get the authentication u need to access ur banking services online. They still need time to fix this app/new system of authentication. Big regret signing on. Worked fine initially but doesn’t work now.,2018-12-21 13:27:43,-1
1,‘Service not available’ : After updating the error ‘Service not available. Try again later or call 1800 111 1111 for assistance.’ keeps popping up no matter how many times I refresh the app. My ibanking works fine on computer but the app is totally not working for me. Please fix this.,2018-12-21 02:19:18,-1

3,Prefer old version : Thanks for putting a lot of effort to upgrade this app. It is quite convenient to us after downloading this app.But actually I prefer the touch ID n we no need to login every time when we use. If cannotat least to have the ID there we just enter the password.How if it will not auto logout unless we press the logout button? It seems more convenient.And I also hope the 'Slide and Peek' can be back coz I like it. I know that some of them don't like but maybe can put it in Setting to turn on and off about the 'Slide and Peek'?Hope to get the latest version soon.Once again thank you for updating the app.,2018-03-30 08:45:25,-1
1,Internet banking login issues : Happen twice now. I keyed in my username and password and press submit once. However it’s straightaway show error message that I have exceeded the number of tries.I have to spend time to get through to customer service officers to verify and unlock my account. It’s really annoying especially when the customer officer treats me like I have forgotten my username and pass and got lock out due to multiple tries. Please fix this issue!!!!!,2017-11-25 12:22:05,-1
1,Bad bad bad : New update is damn bad. I cant even launch my app..... thanks for the update..!,2017-07-26 16:11:44,-1
5,Extremely cluttered : Extremely cluttered,2016-07-14 08:10:29,1
1,App forever loading at login page : Everytime the new updated interface not for user friendly but introduced more and more stupid verification steps. When i need to use the app its just forever loading at the login page after keyed token code. Well done POSB team who developing the app!,2017-06-18 15:33:24,-1
5,Disappointing app and customer service : Trying to activate OneToken after downloading the app. Several attempts wasted with error message. Called customer service. First they tried to pin on the device. Hello both my iPhone and iPad are up-to-date. The the customer was blamed “because you tried so many times”. The reason why customer has tried so many times is obviously that he/she does not succeed in the service activation in any of such attempts. Shouldn’t app quality be questioned instead of customer? Proposed solution: to remove the app reinstall in half an hour. Will update if this works.,2021-09-15 04:15:23,1
2,- : Genuinely surprised to see this app having such a high rating. However upon looking through the reviews I realised that there are many reviews voicing their frustrations only to have a 5 star rating pinned to it. Perhaps users aren’t familiar with the rating system. Anyway this app is really unreliable. A common issue being…….app is not able to load at all and if it did another issue users might face would be the app being ‘temporarily unavailable’. In the event that users finally manage to enter the app there will be times where users get logged out almost immediately due to ‘long periods of inactivity’. Truly dysfunctional. Whenever I intend to make a transaction via PayNow I always check this app in advance as i truly have no idea when there would be errors in logging in (which then affects whether I am able to PayNow). This app has been problematic since forever so i’m really not sure why it hasn’t significantly improved i mean isn’t the loading of the app and the log in something BASIC? I’m not even talking about how user friendly (or not) the app is or about how the app could be potentially lacking in terms of features or about the layout of the app etc. I just want the app to be FUNCTIONING in the first place,2023-02-19 00:27:14,-1
5,Fixed: Cannot access money insights : Overall it does what it says on the box. However recently I have an issue. I use an OCBC debit card but I cannot see the breakdown of my transactions making it impossible to track spending and manage my budget. I could see all these before the update. Am writing here because I can’t find a “ask support” function in the app.Update: after contacting their customer support via their in-app secured mailbox I’m glad to say the issue has been resolved! They were prompt in their responses and fixes. Very grateful.,2021-07-27 10:09:03,1
1,Updated: App Not Ready? — 6 May 2022 Fri : Been waiting for years to install this app after seeing so many bad reviews. Then come news about OCBC wanting to stop the use of physical tokens. I thought that OCBC has finally over come the technological barriers to bring forth a stable app. How wrong of me. Installed on 19 Apr 2022 Tue and tried to activate the OneToken (the replacement for the physical token) on the app. Unsuccessful. After going through days of trying 5 customer service personnels and references of my case to the technical department I still failed to get the OneToken up and running. Oh wow!! How patient I am!! But now I have given up and asked the customer service personnel to close the case even when the problem is not solved. I have since uninstalled the app.This app still need more work to it to be fully functional. — 5 May 2022 ThuUpdate: Something I left out. For those who are concerned with privacy should note what this OCBC banking app does.1) It wants to know your location when you are using the app.2) It wants to know your location when you are NOT using the app.3) It will scan your wifi network when you are on wifi.That’s a lot more than other banking apps I’ve used before.— 6 May 2022 Fri,2022-05-05 17:35:00,-1
5,Not so friendly after u upgrade to a new phone : I recently upgraded to another iPhone and the nightmare started. I tried to activate the one token on the new phone but was told to deactivate first on old phone. There is no option to deactivate on the old phone! Called customer service but not much help !! Now I’m stuck ! I can still access my account from my SIM-less old phone but can’t do anything on the new phone ?!,2021-06-03 13:45:10,1
2,Recent Security Changes : The recent decision for this app to scan your phone for third party apps is at a best a misguided attempt at protecting the vulnerable from harm and at worse a violation of the end user’s basic privacy. To require deletion of third party apps before being allowed to use the app is such an out of touch decision making the lives of people who use such apps knowingly and securely all that much harder. A pity since this app was very useful to have. An alternative approach would be instead to not _force_ deletion but rather make the user aware and allow them to continue their transaction at their own risk. On a more emotional front being treated like a fool who requires constant guidance and protection doesn’t sit right with me.,2023-08-17 10:13:33,-1
1,Worst ever banking Apps : 1. OneToken issue: I was prompted to enable notification upon logging in. After I clicked the “activate” button “OCBC OneToken has been set up on your device.” appeared mysteriously on the screen.2. eStatement password1) I downloaded the eStatement from mobile App. When I tried to erase balance using iPhone in-build Apps password was needed. However after I entered the password it’s said to be invalid.2) I tried to reset it on mobile Apps according to the instructions given on OCBC website but the system kept on telling me that there is an error without specifying what the error was.3) I called OCBC customer service it took sometime for the officer to figure out that “Password can only be changed from internet banking on computer”. I followed the steps instructed by the officer to change the password and used the new password to enable editing of the eStatement that was downloaded after the reset of password it did not work either. It took altogether 45 minutes for the customer officer to troubleshoot and guide me through all the tedious and illogical steps on internet banking and mobile Apps nothing worked at all.,2021-06-02 04:04:34,-1
1,Change new phone - complete disaster : Looks like I’m not the only user encountering this. Changed to a new device and OneToken doesn’t work at all apparently I needed to authorise it using my old phone which thankfully I still had but that function didn’t work too. I was asked to request for a new hardware token just to activate the app on my new phone. And THAT didn’t work too until I was told to delete and reinstall the app. All told I needed to call their help desk three times over two weeks and be put on hold for 15-30 minutes each time. And wait for the new hardware token to be delivered to me. And like someone pointed out - this is a single point of failure. I ran the risk of not paying my bills on time while I was trying to sort out the above. The hardware token is rendered useless while the mobile token is activated. The app team needs a severe rehaul of the UX/UI design. This experience is enough to make me consider switching banks. I was prepared stay loyal to OCBC even with low interest rates because that can’t be helped - but this incompetence cannot be explained away.,2021-01-11 02:07:47,-1
4,Privacy : Hi! Ever since OCBC Pay Anyone app been removed I have been using this app more often for the purpose of scan & pay. Is it possible to add the feature of toggling to hide or reveal the account balance? Also have the balance hidden first after login. If a person wants to view then click to reveal. It will be great to add this feature as I believe that most users do not wish their account balance to be seen by someone else esp someone unknown. Thank you for reading my suggestions. 🙏🏻,2023-10-10 15:10:13,1
5,Process : Unable to transfer to payee  successfully despite using passcode and OCBC providing a auto-message to say looking into it. And it is irritating to have to confirm the scam alert notification for every log in . Please do away with the repeated acknowledgment. It shd be like T&C where it is confirmed one time onlyAnd please … you even restrict the nickname ! It’s a nickname and I have to try so many times cos it’s already taken?! 🙄,2022-04-25 06:15:20,1
1,Very terrible service : I just wanted to open a savings account using my existing customer profile. However I faced an error on the OCBC mobile app stating that I’ve already opened an account when I haven’t. I called the customer officer hoping to get some help but without advising me what I can do online first the customer officer just tried to brush me off by telling me to go down to the branch. We are living in an advanced technology era. Why the heck do I need to waste time to go down to the branch just to open a new account? Then what is the point of having this online application for account opening when it doesn’t even function well. DISAPPOINTING!,2023-12-05 09:00:51,-1
1,Don’t fix things which are not broken : The new UI requires more steps to transfer to a given UEN. Worse the reference text (now somehow called Message) does not appear editable (no blinking cursor I had to try typing something to test poor choice of widget) and cannot paste text from elsewhere into it. It is very inconvenient because sometimes the other parties require to indicate the invoice number for example. Last but not least this text message does not show in the post transfer screen so when it is shared with the recipients they can’t tell if it has been done correctly.The old UX is way better.,2022-12-31 00:38:18,-1
5,Latest update doesn’t work : iPhone13 on latest iOS crashes after latest update very slow crashes often network connection problems can’t use it to do simple transactions like pay bills or even send feedback. Weird blank pop-ups with words “object-object”. The previous update was much easier to use,2023-01-06 07:56:03,1
5,Latest Updates With Bugs : The recent update for OCBC digital has a pop up security message and I am unable to click “proceed” due to the enlarged message size neither am I able to scroll it down. The phone model that I am using is IPhone SE please have it fix asap as I uses the phone app to do bank transfers. Thank you,2023-01-02 08:16:41,1
1,App Hangs On Splash Page : App doesn’t load pass the splash page with the OCBC logo. It hasn’t been able to load for 2 weeks now and it totally wrecks chaos to my mobile internet banking activities. What’s worse is i can’t even login via their webpage as i need the authentication from the app. There seems to be no urgency from the bank to solve this problem as i’ve seen several reviews with the same problem. It’s utterly disappointing when a bank like them can’t even deliver their brand promise which is to truly understand the desires and needs of their customers. Now that’s Simply Spot On i say.,2022-02-10 16:39:32,-1
1,No transaction details on bank transfers done : This is such a trash app already feedback sometime ago but there’s still no action taken to rectify it. We desperately need to have the transaction details for bank transfer done !!! what’s the point of keying in the details on your message column which only the payee can see but we as the payer can’t see it when the bank transfer is completed !!! How else can we know what we’ve paid by bank transfer when there’s no transaction record !!! pls URGENTLY rectify it !!!! This is the 2nd time that i’m reiterating this issue pls do not make me reiterate a 3rd time !!!,2023-01-13 15:34:42,-1
2,Reauthentication needs improvement : Can you please improve the reauthentication experience? When I relaunch the app after a while I was asked to authenticate with Face ID after which the app told me that my session has expired and ask me to auth with Face ID again (even though I’ve just done that a minute ago). Once I’ve done that I’m brought to the main screen which is frozen. I had to kill the app and restart the whole process. In general I had to log in with Face ID 3 times whenever I relaunch the app from the background.,2023-08-05 05:25:56,-1
4,Horrible experience : Can’t seem to change to sign in on my other mobile. Keep asking me to use one token if I don’t get the otp but the one token can’t even work via the mobile app. Kept on deleting app and reinstalling it many times. Worst app ever. And no matter how many times I update my phone it still doesn’t sent me my otp on my mobile. Really need to look into getting a professional app developer!,2020-12-28 11:53:55,1
4,Ux is good but.. : I want to do something as simple as changing the account name so I can sort out the multiple accounts for me and my kids but there’s NOTHING on app that informs me I had to look all over the app and there isn’t even a help on mobile. Why is this simple function only available on desktop? It should be something made easy for users to achieve on mobile.,2023-05-24 02:57:20,1
3,defunct payanyone app : not sure why the payanyone app is removed since Oct 23. the only benefit of a separate app was so that when making payment for instore purchases there’s no need to open the main app which shows your balance to possibly the queue behind you. i assumed that the main ocbc app would mirror this by allowing you to select paynow before logging into your account yet it does not support QR. huh?? integrate all its function if you wanna remove payanyone.,2023-09-26 10:38:51,-1
5,Overall all the functionality works : Functionality works fine. But lacks in user friendliness. Lacks with native iOS experience.Eg: every time have to scroll to the bottom to choose the accounts after coming back from accounts detail page.,2023-08-23 13:13:24,1
1,Terrible app terrible bank : Everyone should read the 5 star reviews. Many of them are 5 stars but details the app as terrible. Don’t be fooled by the 5 star ratings.A fundamental job of the app is OneToken.If you exit the app without logging out and you request a one token authentication - once you press the notification instead of being able to authorise the transaction you are greeted with a notice telling you you have been logged out instead.This bug has been present since 2000 (and god knows how long before that). Such a fundamental bug that disables a key function of the app and it not being fixed shows you their properties.Meanwhile they are overzealous about warning you of scams - you can’t disable the notices even though you’ve read it over and over. There is a fundamental disrespect for the customer in this regard. We are not all fools.,2023-10-05 11:52:59,-1
5,Very lag and takes long time to load : Don’t know what happen to the apps… nowadays it takes quite a long time to load the apps and got kick out frm the apps a few time… it’s quite frustrating especially when I’m using the QR scan to make payment or withdraw money… I’m like holding up the Q…,2022-12-27 11:23:12,1
5,OCBC Pay Anyone apps merge with OCBC Digital : OCBC Digital apps is perfect.Would like to suggest highly negative rating and unpopular “ OCBC Pay Anyone “ apps to be scrapped and that function should be included in the “OCBC Digital ” apps. This will more appropriate to use only one single Apps as “Digital “ rather than two separate apps way more than unprofessional and unproductive.,2022-08-20 03:04:55,1
4,Error : App’s great. But recently am not able to log in to check bank balance etc. Error message kept asking to check internet connection. But the same problem kept recurring regardless on data or wifi. But able to make transfers from the quick click option on the main page though. Pls advise :),2021-04-26 13:06:14,1
1,app loads slowly : this app loads EXTREMELY slowly. sometimes it doesn’t even load the login page for me and i am unable to login and use paynow or any features. this does not correspond with my internet connection or maintenance periods since even when i have stellar wifi and am using the app on non-maintenance periods the app still runs slow when it is supposed to work fine. how can i use this app if i cannot even rely on it to login? please optimise your app ocbc!!! users need to be able to login properly to even use your app!,2023-02-22 14:06:38,-1
1,Every page takes at least half a min to load after updating to 14.4 : As per title. After asking for face ID it just keeps spinning for about half a minute then showed a blank screen for half a minute before showing the summary page. Make a transfer to my own account and takes another half a minute then suddenly tells me the internet appears offline. Transferring to my goals take more than half a minute each. The app takes so long to do everything it's practically not usable.,2021-09-01 13:41:52,-1
5,Transaction thru credit card counted twice : Currently the transaction happened thru credit card was counted twice in the money insight. All the transactions are already reflected in the details and the credit card bills are also counted again pls look into this.,2023-01-09 01:51:17,1
5,Redemption of SSB : There is no option to redeem the bond amount via mobile app unlike the UOB mobile app it can be done on the go(anytime anywhere). The current option to redeem SSB is to do it at the physical ATM machine which I feel is really inconvenience.  Please improve in this aspect for the convenience of all OCBC users like myself. Thank you.,2021-06-30 02:40:29,1
5,Phone gets extremely hot : I am using iOS 14.4. Whenever I went to check transactions on this app the phone gets super hot within a minute and battery drained 3% in just less than 2 mins of usage. Please fix this as I am not intending to purchase a new iPhone just because of this heat issue.,2021-03-16 07:04:40,1
5,Best User Interface Design : The title says it all. Every bank app can probably perform the same tasks but the OCBC app does it in a simple and intuitive manner. You will probably not switch your bank because of an app but if you already have an OCBC account please consider using the app. It is great. Thank you.,2021-06-29 07:58:23,1
4,Getting slower and hang more often : Have been using the apps for many years.. the initial response is still quite good.. but lately the app always kick me out saying idle for too long which I pause using only for less than 1 min to look at the notification from my phone after I completed an operation in the app.,2023-10-04 01:52:37,1
5,screen and phone freeze : The screen and phone will freeze sometimes when using the app. Cannot do anything for a good 60 seconds. Need to keep trying to do a forced reboot of the phone before the phone re-boots.Assessing Other banks app do not have these problems ..,2021-02-08 22:12:32,1
5,Can’t load in : App getting longer or cannot load in at all.Cannot do fund transfer sometimes or many times finished fund transfer then cannot check balance in account. Last time never like this. Why this app getting lousier??,2023-08-28 03:07:18,1
5,App loading is comparatively slower than other apps. : This problem is made worse when it’s lunch hour rush and I need to make payment via it’s scan and pay function. The loading time makes it look like I’m using a dinosaur phone.,2023-04-07 06:53:12,1
3,Updates with worse features : The app is laggy and now the comment box forTransfer - you tried to make it fancy but it is so user unfriendly. I can’t reject suggested auto fill- and it includes a special character which you do not accept. I tried to shift the cursor to the special character to delete but could not be done. Please don’t be fancy if that means basic functions removed.,2023-04-11 13:29:12,-1
5,Is OCBC onetoken down? : I have been using the OCBC app on my mobile phone and today when I tried to login it prompted that onetoken has to be reactivated on my device and proceeded to attempt to load. Then I kept getting the same message that the service is unavailable. For the whole day????,2020-12-02 12:18:35,1
3,Latest update is missing a few creature comforts : It’s no longer possible (or I’m missing a trick) to add comments via copy and paste for things like reference numbers. Would be nice have this feature reinstated again. Does what it says on the tin but I still find the best user experience to be with DBS mobile app! Would be nice to see OCBC step up to the plate in a more meaningful way other than just looking nice(r),2022-12-31 16:34:01,-1
5,App always hangs with white screen : The app always freezes with a white screen when I put it in background. Also was trying to check on my credit card details when it became white screen again.,2023-02-17 16:27:36,1
2,The only local bank app that can’t even get the basic right : When their web site login triggers a 2nd factor authentication the app can’t proceed by presenting a “time out” error. No other local bank apps has this problem. I tried to use it to pay my bill via AXS app and again the same time out problem. Now I am stuck and unable to pay my bill. I really wonder what kind of testing was before they released it.,2023-12-04 10:33:26,-1
5,User friendly : Managed to activate onetoken on new device smoothly. UI is straightforward to use and can get a glance of everything at summary view. Can improve on loading speed as sometimes loading of details may take a bit of time.,2021-01-13 07:56:34,1
1,App doesn’t load most of the time : It’s been quite often the app doesn’t work be it using 4G or my home wifi at full strength. It will try to login and display internet connection isn’t good error which is definitely a generic error as I am using home wifi It’s frustrating and I suspect the app is unable to handle multiple login requests at the same . You want reliability in app and I like to add all the fancy pictures and UI doesn’t help in any way for me to want to use the app.  please check.,2023-01-27 04:11:52,-1
4,WHAT? To use physical token again? : What a joke. The OneToken doesn’t work. So I reinstalled the app after trying unsuccessfully no less than 9 times to re-activate my one token. Now it’s asking me to use the physical token that I stopped using more than a year ago. The battery is dead. The account access is dead. The App is dead! What a bunch of losers trying to be hip and digital. Gosh!,2020-12-02 03:51:20,1
3,Broken payment confirmations after last update : I used to pay my SP bills via their app using linked OCBC credit card. Payment confirmation was received by sms. Now after the recent update’s confirmation is done via app push.As a result payment transactions are never complete and displayed as in progress forever.Please test integrations carefully before introducing such braking changes.,2023-04-02 01:06:40,-1
1,Disappointed : It takes FIVE days to get a response which is a little too late when we need to apply for a time-based promo. Rates are not updated in real time. This is NOT acceptable. How to trust if I’m getting best rates when I use online application?  Is it so hard to just pick up the phone and give me a call instead of ding donging messages and hiding behind this App if you simply cannot get what I had raised. Poor service level. Up to 4-5 messages now - I don’t have the time to do this with you OCBC ! My time is PRECIOUS.,2022-08-07 06:41:45,-1
5,The application makes Islamic Accounts : The ease for the use of the digital world. OCBC makes Islamic Banking and finance easier than ever before. It battles the munafiq state and In Sha Allah better the lives of everyday Singaporean MalaysianIndonesianModern day Burma. And most and foremost Vietnam and Greater China for greater days ahead. Warmest regards Encik Muhammad Afiq Bin Mohd Arshad Bin Ibrahim Bin Abdullah / Mr Keling Long LeLove for the sake of Allah SWT and Rasulullah SAW. In Sha Allah.,2023-10-16 01:08:40,1
1,Annoying messages : For a bank that claims to have great CX and human interaction they are not very humanize. Can the app stop asking me to activate the money lock? Who the hell use moneylock in a bank?? If people has that much money to lock it away they will put it in a secret vault not in a digital money “lock”. Give customers to disable these messages. I don’t need the feature now I probably won’t need the feature 5 mins later. Also there is a negative review with negative words but a 5 stars? Obvious a fake review,2024-02-02 03:34:27,-1
1,App extremely slow on mobile data. : Reset the phone changed telco. Singtel M1 & MyRepublic all unable to login most of the time. Only home wifi works. Tried two different phone issue persist. Scam alert feature should be able to turn off after few reminders or have the option to manually turn off. The app is already not loading properly on mobile data the scam alert feature makes it worst. Overall crap experience on OCBC app. POSB/DBS is much more smoother.,2022-05-16 17:48:32,-1
5,Seamless but buggy one token authorisation : One token has big defect that if old device is not available or old device can’t update to latest app version you can’t do any transactions on other device! Will consider other banks due to this troublesome design,2021-02-05 16:43:54,1
1,excessive scam alert in login : Displaying the scam alert on EVERY login serves no good than to waste ~5seconds of our lives per login.How many times will the user need to acknowledge the message before they can learn?Will they recall better on the tenth times than the first?Everyone will just scroll straight to the checkbox and get it over with.Worst is when you have a new notice and the hardened users will just treat it like the previous one and skip ahead.Perhaps a short quiz after the alert will be more productive or even just showing it only on the nth login is will be sufficient as a reminder.I’ve always love your app but this is beyond stupid.Do follow the best practices and provide an option to skip it on subsequent login.I’ll move to another bank if this continues on the next app update.,2022-02-03 09:40:37,-1
5,Fantastic UIUX : Kudos to the OCBC digital team for your most excellent banking app. User experience is top notch and your feature rich suite of services obviates the need for analog banking. A suggestion - if you could enable card loyalty point redemptions on your app that would be amazing. Thanks and well done.,2024-02-08 00:26:24,1
1,IF THIS IS MY PERSONAL ACCOUNT DO NOT ANYHOW LOCKED MY ACCOUNT : Ocbc called me i lock out from my login page. To check whether the transaction is fraud or not. You can simply locked my account and i have to wait for 12hours. Now is more then 12 hours and I can’t even login to my account!!! Now i’ve tried to login many times cannot login. Expect me to go down to branch expect me to have my token. I have bedridden father at home. This is such a hassle for me!!! THE WORST BANK EVER! Since i have to rate i give it 1 star. Prolly 0 is what i wanted to give,2024-03-18 10:16:05,-1
2,Too many good-to-haves without fulfilling basics : Many features too many such that it can be difficult out to navigate around. Core functionalities like finding out credit card transactions are hard to find. Very slow rendering of pages relative to other mobile banking apps. Not a good user experience in summary the slow and unintuitive navigation makes it an app that requires much patience to use,2023-09-21 22:53:21,-1
3,Improvements needed : There is no option to add/delete credit cards in the Pay Bills section. And the shortcut buttons should reflect what the user used most. The Pay Bills icon appear on the starting page but not after login. User needs to tap 4 times to get to Pay Credit Card subsection. And there’s no customer feedback link in the app... which is unusual.,2021-02-19 02:34:32,-1
5,Cannot use anymore : After an update 2 days ago i cant even open the app anymore. Keeps showing the message “retrieving ocbc onetoken” over and over but i cant access my account!! This is very troublesome and is disappointing!!,2020-12-02 04:52:39,1
3,Push notification all gone : My one token is unable to send push notifications (no notification at all even when i opened the app manually)  and resulted in me unable to pay for some online stuff. The reminder on bill payment is also gone causing a late fee which cannot be waived after the update of app.,2023-04-01 04:04:54,-1
2,User experience : The ocbc app had been updated in terms of colour scheme and layout. The good thing is that there are more icons/graphics however the colour of like grey against white makes it difficult for readers with poor eyesight. I also noticed the fonts become smaller..If we are encouraging more users to use the app pls make the option of fonts available and contrast of fonts with background more obvious. Thank you.,2023-02-09 00:07:39,-1
3,Problem with using VoiceOver : Using VoiceOver. Under the investment sub menu I used to able to see the different investment options under the investment sub menu. However now voice over can only tell me for different options as sub menu items. So there is no way for me to tell what is the investment options in the particular sub menu,2024-02-01 13:36:37,-1
1,OCBC post saga too many problems : First is getting password is so troublesome and need access key - these measures are just too much.Recently went backwards by removing ability to put comments or manual notes and only allow preset notes - I used to use OCBC and the app to make transfers and I need to make notes that appear per line transaction which doesn’t appear now really one step forward 10 steps backPls do landscape study with Uob/DBS / Standard Chartered that are faring much better,2023-02-11 13:28:28,-1
1,Practically unusable on iPhoneSE 1st gen : For many tasks the app now shows a warning screen to warn about scams. This screen is NOT scrollable and take up the entire screen on an iPhoneSE 1st gen with only the very few pixels of the top of the dismiss button showing which is nearly impossible to press. This blocks some important functionalities of the app. Very bad user experience with this warning screen implementation. The rest of the app while somewhat sluggish are still usable on these smaller devices.,2023-01-30 14:18:12,-1
5,Best local banking app so far to date ! : OCBC banking app is not only user-friendly it’s safe  simple & easy to use  it’s so much better when comparing to the other local banking apps  keep up the good work  keep improving on it & stay on top of yr competitors!,2024-01-12 13:23:21,1
5,APP KEEP HAVING TECHNICAL ISSUE : app was already worst in the first place now even worst. uninstall and install multiple times not working!!!my phone become extremely hot whenever i launch in the ocbc app and batt will start to drain!! im not the only person encountering this issue,2020-12-02 16:10:27,1
1,Worst unreliable banking app : The number of times this application has failed me is really frustrating. First the fact that I had to wait for 20 mins just to get a OTP pin so I can scan and pay for my food is already frustrating enough. Infuriating as it is the numerous attempts I tried again was already making my blood boil. Disappointingly enough I ended up not being able to purchase anything. This is the WORST application ever UNRELIABLE and I’ve had enough of this.,2022-10-28 01:48:33,-1
2,Issues with how fast transactions load in : Am I the only one whos transactions load in super slowly?? Like for example i would purchase something in an online game on my phone and it literally takes days or weeks for the transaction to load in. I don't see a refresh function on the app so I don't know what to do... The only thing that loads in fast is deposits when I go to the bank machine..,2021-11-24 05:54:51,-1
5,Unable to use the app : Every time I try using the app it would say temporarily unavailable. Please check your internet connection and relaunch the app. Did that did not solve the issue. Reinstalling also doesn't work.,2021-04-27 10:52:28,1
2,See Full Details option for Credit Cards not working : Hi OCBC Dev team the functionality for showing the full details for credit cards got broken in the recent versions and transactions are not named. Pressing on the “show full details” option does not work for showing the named cards’ transactions. This makes it hard to check for unauthorised use. iOS 16.7.2  on most recent ver. 18.8 of the app. Thanks.,2023-12-28 10:42:10,-1
1,Bring back option to include details about the payments made on the app : I see that after the app update the feature that allows users to include small notes about their paynow payments is gone. Kindly bring back this feature so that it is easier for customers to validate each outflow of cash. In making changes pls don’t make it harder for customers to check their account transactions by dropping payment details.,2022-12-24 18:02:10,-1
1,App just gets more and more unstable : Yesterday I can scan QR to pay now and today can’t even scan. It’s really embarrassing to hog queue when it’s suppose to work. Even the basic functions to view accounts gets stuck with blank screen need to restart a few times the app to get it to work. Just horrible to the point I am thinking to close off OCBC account as it worries me if I will be able to get money out one day when the app just breaks,2024-01-11 11:56:24,-1
1,App not accessible : I have not been able to login to ocbc app lately. I use iphone ios 12 and after the app loads and opens all i see is the ocbc logo in the page as if it is going to load the page. But nothing happens after that point; not even like it is hung; just that page. I don’t know what is the issue. Haven’t been able to login to my online banking for a while now as if i do so from the laptop too it asks for app otp or app aunthentication!,2022-02-25 09:28:49,-1
5,Improve sharing image : It is best if you could improve by sharing image after done the PayNow or bank transfer instead of we have to screenshot the whole image rather than just sharing the texts that we have transferred the payment. Like how Uob does.,2020-12-04 08:05:21,1
5,Change of transfer limit : Restrictive and slow. Unable to transfer to my related accounts even after daily limit has been activated. Lousy,2022-08-20 16:23:17,1
1,onboarding process have to be relooked : new joiner trying to open an account. cannot access banking on website and app because the process has many tokens pins and card numbers to be consumed all for different purposes. Activating a pin for online banking got logged out. Help line redirected to bot which redirects to online form which said cannot log which directs to bot again. stuck and no help. waste of time please help me close my account  thanks,2024-02-15 15:45:12,-1
5,Superb service : Amazing fast service by OCBC Tampines branch. Went to branch to open account at 11:00 got number at 11:10 and by 12:00 noon the account was opened also they gave me physical debit card and internet banking activated. Thank you OCBC for the speedy and hassle free process.,2023-08-13 05:09:58,1
3,Can’t hide account balance when open this app for pay now : If you are taking away OCBC anyone app and want us to use OCBC digital then please let us hide our bank acc financial info…or at least let us go straight to scan to pay instead of show my account balance another info when open this app.,2023-10-02 05:23:32,-1
4,OCBC bug : Bug :While in money insight : back button does not work this we are stuck in this screen on the mobile appFeatures :-One view and money lock information/sections taks take half of the screen when we click on what you have section. Those items should be temporary or move somewhere where it does not disturb navigation. (Before it was only oneview but now with moneylock it’s just too much information cluttering the screen) -360 percentage Interest earned each month missing in the app -Dark mode not supported yet,2024-04-11 05:53:40,1
3,Cannot paste when trying to add message on the transfer : Ever since the app got upgraded to the new ui i cannot paste text on the Add Message field when trying to do a transfer. Pls fix this as sometimes we need to add account numbers in the comments especially when transferring to robos or other trading apps,2023-02-01 21:44:11,-1
1,The App from time to time will have issue and so lagging in the old phone. : The App was so lagging on old phone where other Bank app can work smoothly on old phone. Some time have keep error and have to uninstall and reinstall and I have to login to PC for transactions...OCBC as a large cooperation I am really disappointed of their standard to have such software development to design the app which have caused so many issue and so lagging in the old phone.,2021-06-02 08:38:44,-1
2,App keeps on crashing : The app used to be great I was able to easily check my balance etc. However its been almost a month and I couldnt access it. It kept on saying I have internet problems even though I do not. Tried to install & uninstall the app multiple times but to no avail. Please fix this issue I see other users experiencing the same thing as well.,2021-05-02 05:01:01,-1
1,OneToken is bad : Cant manage to log in on new device after changing phone found out its bc this onetoken thing can only be activated on one device. Cant figure out how to deactivate it / reactivate on new device. When i clicked on “manage onetoken” on the app no actions could be taken. Called bank a few times too but always busy. Server on application also always states that its unavailable always asking me to try again later....,2020-12-28 17:01:22,-1
1,Getting bad to worst : Is there a new IT team? App performance getting from bad to worst! OCBC app to be good many years ago but lately it has been so buggy and problematic. In terms of intuitiveness responsiveness and logic of app design other banks are surpassing OCBC. Do the team even test the app out whenever they roll out something new? I’m writing this review with frustration now as the OneToken is not working and I basically cannot perform any banking as the web version requires OneToken too. This is horrendous for a highly digital era.,2020-12-13 14:20:49,-1
5,Can’t even download : I tried downloading the app since two hours ago and it is not able to be downloaded. Ridiculous when I can download other apps.,2024-01-26 02:08:50,1
1,Catastrophic failure of app : Mobile and online banking all depend on the one token creating a single point of failure. This failure has been total tantamount to the bank closing down for a few days locking out access to our funds without providing an alternative. By denying access to all banking functions money has been locked up without the customer’s permission the bank has failed at the very basic premise of being a bank.How will anyone ever trust that the online banking platform again? That’s without considering all the people who were inconvenienced even embarrassed when they had to explain to others why they could not send the money cos “the bank app failed”. Yah right... So the only question left now is how will you make this right?,2020-12-06 09:55:26,-1
4,Occasional crash/ slow loading : Kindly see to this matter ^ sometimes it takes really long for me to launch the app and I need to retry multiple times. There are times the app crashes too. Please make the customer experience more seamless!,2021-06-17 12:41:15,1
5,Changing phone : Just to share. Recently I’ve upgraded my iPhone. Unable to login to my account even when I’m using the browser. So I try to delete the app & re-downloaded it & now I’m able to login. Smooth transaction so far.,2021-02-22 18:05:15,1
5,Login unavailable : Recently can’t login to homepage. Keep hang on the login page or turn white blank page. Tried many days but still the same issue.,2023-02-20 16:33:48,1
3,Better UI please waiting for next update : It would be fantastic if the recents tab under Paynow have the option to instantly delete recent payees. It is so annoying to have a big list of recent payees just there I hate it when there is something I can’t clear. Please do look into this thanks,2024-02-27 10:49:27,-1
4,Haven’t been able to open it for years! : Not sure when it started but it doesn’t work and hasn’t for years now. Even when I update it. I try to press abt button and it does to a completely blank white screen.,2021-04-15 11:57:32,1
5,Issue logging in : The app keeps crashing every time after I login. This has been happening for the past few days. Is there a maintenance or something?,2021-04-26 13:17:45,1
3,Unstable connection : The functions of the app are very comprehensive. However there have been many occasions where the loading takes quite a while and it eventually logs out. I hope this can be improved to provide a better user experience. The convenience is great!,2022-07-07 04:15:44,-1
5,Same problem. Lousy app cannot use on new phone : Freaking frustrating experience. Up to now I can use the app on my new phone bcoz the otp cannot be generated via the new phone. The button isn’t working. Same as the above user,2020-12-03 09:34:34,1
4,Missing feature : May I suggest to put back display of the day of the week like before when setting a future date for bill payment/transfer as we may want to avoid weekends.,2024-03-18 08:22:56,1
3,Updated but can’t open? : I just bought iPhone 14 pro max and the ocbc app is updated to latest update yet when I open the app it says pls use the latest version of the app when click ok brings me to App Store which shows its updated to latest version but still can’t open!,2023-07-16 07:56:19,-1
5,Can’t launch the app : The app has been crashing since last week and there’s basically nothing I can do to transfer my funds via the app. I can’t even login,2021-05-05 05:55:30,1
1,Poor reliability : Despite updates and bug fixes the OCBC app leaves much to be desired. Simple reliability is not in-built - many app crashes and disability to launch. A half-baked banking app that heats up my phone to temperatures akin to the surface of the sun - why? I don’t even think the developers know. OCBC follow the lead of the other banks and put investment in your mobile app. It’s the time of digital banking so get your act together or lose your customers.,2022-02-02 05:04:20,-1
5,IOS LOG IN : since yesterday l I cannot access my online banking... the ocbc application is not working and not logging into my account.Causing so much trouble as I cannot access  my funds to online transaction,2020-12-02 14:14:42,1
5,App keeps hanging : App keeps hanging like 5 out of 10 times that I open it. I have accounts with DBS and UOB and none of their apps hang like OCBC... DBS app use to have this problem but I guess they’d fixed it. Please do something about it asap,2021-01-03 02:04:23,1
1,Worst banking app : The OCBC bank app is the worst banking app I have ever used. It keeps getting stuck as soon as I enter it every day. It is not smooth at all. I can’t get out of the interface after waiting for a few minutes. It just keeps going around and around and I don’t know what to do! Can you put your heart into making your app? The bank is so big but so poor that the app is not willing to upgrade,2023-09-29 07:51:35,-1
2,Poor UI and experience : So many clicks to get a transfer or payment done. No favourites or shortcuts to make regular payments/ transfer easier. Have my feedback through phone and it was useless. Words are too small.  You can see where their focus is when new updates keep adding new bloat but not actual improvements.,2021-06-06 08:07:57,-1
2,Extremely buggy : Poorly designed and buggy app. I don’t understand why I have to scan my Face ID twice once just for opening the app and another time via singpass. Seems like the first scan is unnecessary as it doesn’t do anything. Lately I can’t even log in as the first Face ID scan will revert me back to the login page in a never ending loop.,2023-06-08 12:50:47,-1
1,One token issue : Change new phone and prompted on new phone by app. It was asked to reactivate and I did however the app has keep detecting new phone and wanted me reactivate One token which caused alot of inconvenience. Not sure is it because I’m using physical sim and esim at the same time so whenever simcard switch on and off it trigger this issue. I did not face any issue with other bank tho. Please get the IT team to solve this issue asap.,2023-01-09 16:52:36,-1
5,Worst apps ever : When internet is not strong it will appear detected new device and required to activate one token again and again. No one going to improve this. I’m so disappointed on OCBC apps developers.,2022-01-27 05:37:04,1
4,Change transfer limit : Cannot find where to change the transfer limit to other account.  Only can change paynow limit ..,2022-12-08 03:41:09,1
1,Customer service : I’m just curious is there only 1 person working in the customer service sector in ocbc or what? I called for 1h+ and there was no one to pick up the phone and this happened to me for multiple days. It is seriously frustrating and I don’t have all that time to wait. No wonder people using ocbc always get scammed because the customer service takes forever to contact,2022-01-19 02:24:41,-1
2,Stopped working with iOS 14.5 : This app is generally stable and useful (other than annoying SMS otp verification multiple times for the same transaction).But with the latest update to iOS 14.5 the app doesn’t work anymore on my phone. There’s a message asking to connect to internet and then promptly the exit screen comes up saying session lasted 9 seconds.,2021-04-29 09:25:36,-1
3,App is getting slower by the day : It used to be fine but ever since the anti scam notice update the app has been slow and buggy. After FaceID verification the loader doesn’t move away which mandates an app restart and sometimes certain menu options cause the app to load non-stop.,2022-09-03 09:52:19,-1
2,Can’t hide the amount balance! : It’s super lousy that such a privacy app can’t provide a basic feature where allows users to hide the amount balance…  you can image that every time you use this app to paynow to others and the very first thing you login is it will show the amount to anybody that glances at your phone…,2023-09-22 12:06:55,-1
3,Is there a timely update on account balance? : I am not sure whether it’s only from my part. I see that the account balance is not updated on spot whenever there is a transaction. The account balance shown in app is different from the actual amount shown at ATM.,2023-03-19 10:11:22,-1
5,Heat issue with the app : OCBC banking app for IOS is generating excessive heat on my 12 pro max. The phone heat up instantly after opening the app without even login in.  It can go up to as high as 45deg C when I measure surface of my phone physically.Please look into the issue asap.,2020-12-07 14:27:52,1
5,Wealth app should see all holdings across ocbc group : Why can’t we view shares holdings under OCBC securities and insurance plans in Great Eastern under this App? This gives a better overall picture of clients wealth with ocbc group.,2021-04-02 20:53:29,1
1,Slow : Until today almost 1 month passed since my application on 10 Sep yet I’m still haven’t received my Online Banking details. Total of 16 working days passed. Promised of 5-7 working days has missed and so the promotion period until end Sep22 has missed Given up for such lousy OCBC customer service with only option to call the bank for you to call and wait for nothing🙃,2022-10-03 22:30:18,-1
1,Tons of bugs in the app : The mobile app is so buggy and usability has not improved over time. I can be trying to submit a transaction and suddenly I’m logged out for “inactivity”. This happens to be multiple times or when I’m trying to do something else in the app. How frustrating is that when you’re trying to do something simple yet the app doesn’t allow you to do so?,2022-03-23 02:20:31,-1
5,Cannot log in : There must be a reason why this app receives such a low rating... I don’t believe it until now. It is really the worst online banking experience I ever had.,2020-12-03 04:20:25,1
1,Inefficient bank : A very horrendous banking experience here not just digitally. Same as some of the many people here i was being told by the contact centre that they will solve my issue and get back to me. It has been three weeks but no news. In addition during covid phase 1 i wanted to do housing loan repricing. But i was told by the housing loan side that due to covid they are not able to respond so fast. Wow! I thought it is the best managed bank during covid as you all call it?,2020-12-07 13:49:02,-1
2,Take longer time to open the app : Every time I tap the app it just shows me the OCBC logo but not opening at all  I've deleted and downloaded the app few times every time when I downloaded and it works for me to use once after 2nd attempt when wanted to log in it hang again. Seriously what is happening?,2024-03-19 05:26:11,-1
1,Horrible : It is perhaps the worst banking application I have seen in Southeast n south Asia. Very limited features and payment options Ltd peer-to-peer options limited consumer payment options to merchants example top ups to prepaid cards et cetera. Navigation of the application is horrendous. Better to use other Singapore banks which provide a lot more features and are extremely easy to use for consumers. This app is a waste of time!!,2023-04-18 04:11:03,-1
1,Unable to activate OneToken : Changed of iPhone. Nightmare begins just to activate OneToken on new iPhone. Keep saying need to deactivate old device and activate on new device. Successfully activated with received sms new 6 digit number but bloody OCBC screen is blank. Exit n reboot 10 times still the same stupid blank screen. Email and sms received successfully activated. Now I can’t even perform desktop online banking etc… bloody app & programmer.,2021-06-27 08:29:16,-1
1,Unable to launch the app : Since mid of April  whenever I open the app I get a pop up message saying that push notifications feature is up and running and when I press “okay got it” button I get a message saying that “Sorry we are temporarily unavailable . Please check your internet connection ! “ Tried reaching to customer care via email  no response either !,2021-05-06 00:40:14,-1
5,The payment is disappointed : I would like to pay my due payment on easicredit there is no direct way to pay it.,2023-02-25 09:41:27,1
5,Pay GE policy : Great system and even know which policy is due for payment.  Easier than PayLah! Must transfer $ forgot my passwords as different ones between Their system,2021-12-07 04:03:21,1
2,Slow loading : The app load very slow whenever accessing the page. Not sure it is because of the transition effects but logging in is even worse. Sometime loading for the transaction history will get time out and require to login in again too.,2022-12-27 00:36:02,-1
5,Not able to login : You got to fix this bug for IPhone  I can’t even login to check my basic OCBC. Please do and fix it . Is been so long and this bug is not recovered ?,2021-02-11 10:30:39,1
1,Horrible : Changed phone and the one token is a nightmare. Keep asking me to deactivate it on the old phone but unable to. I ended up deleting the app on the old phone after trying to figure out the problem for v long. Had to change pin because need to log in to activate one token on new phone. End up unable to as it does not allow me to. So irritated with this. Please upgrade your platform.,2021-10-25 14:21:46,-1
1,Never experienced a bank app that broken : The previous version was working very well. Beside the change in design which i can't say is an improvement there is no improvement in functionality. Except maybe the fact that it now hang all the time. And when it does work it is slow. ps. i do miss the pie chart. Update. New version still crashes all the time. Thanks OCBC,2021-06-23 13:01:33,-1
5,Security of the OCBC digital app : Actually with the recent increasing scams from OCBC  I was quite sceptical about the security of this digital application. Other banks have implemented MFA login on their app as additional security layer wander if OCBC wouldimplement this feature on their app?,2022-01-08 13:26:52,1
1,What’s wrong with your app?!?! : Today I am unable to make payment to pay another bank’s credit card in spite of multiple tries whereas I was able to pay my bill using another bank’s app. So it’s really your app problem. And twice I tried to report this problem using secured mailbox but your stupid app just close before I was done typing!! So frustrating!,2023-09-12 08:03:01,-1
1,Mobile app login session management or u get a blank screen mobile app : Recent notice mobile banking app idle session hang at blank screen. Or direct from website url open mobile app in blank screen. It is not as smooth using the OCBC digital mobile.15 Mar still as bad. Mobile app Login then move to another app & go back app (definitely not idle session timeout) is a blank page/screen. Troublesome….,2023-03-15 02:49:40,-1
3,Register for Touch ID never works : The option to register for Touch ID log in never works on the app I tried multiple times but everytime it reaches the page to submit it hangs. Till now I am still unable to do touch id log in for my ocbc accounts app.,2022-01-29 13:42:20,-1
5,No option to see credit line like earlier : No option to see credit line like earlier,2022-08-29 05:05:26,1
3,Phone heats up when I use the app : My iPhone 12 Pro Max gets very hot near the cameras when using this app. Seems like it is a common problem and I’m not sure what is the issue. Have no issues using the app itself interface is good and convenient. Just concerned with this overheating.,2021-10-08 01:43:23,-1
2,Raven🫣 : I’m been using this apps for more than 3 years. And don’t know what happened after now days white blank screen after processing to transfer page can’t do anything hang there very long refresh the app still the same uninstall and reinstall back still not working well.,2023-11-26 01:05:10,-1
5,Savings Account Feature! : Love the savings account features. Really teaches me discipline to save my money before transferring to different accounts. Thank you!,2023-03-31 06:49:05,1
1,Terrible app : For a banking app this app is unreliable. It is a concern that basic functionalities such as viewing accounts and balances transfers do not work quite often with spinning wheels and timeouts on a quite frequent basis. I have to login again and again and it’s a complete waste of my time. No point focusing on the app design and adding new features when you can’t do the banking basics. Hire better engineers.,2022-11-28 23:28:39,-1
2,Kept unable to log in app : I had gone trough customer service to reset my online banking pin but after a few days again I cannot log in my OCBC app. This is so frustrating.

1,Why credit card not listed in the app? : I just recently applied OCBC credit card. But credit card not listed inside the app! I cannot find my credit card activities!

4,Increasing Transfer Limit : Could not find the option to increase the daily limit. Should improve increase on the functions and simplicity.,2021-10-13 00:37:05,1
2,Push notification for transaction authorization not working : Now I can’t make online payment because I receive no push notification for transaction authorization. And unfortunately there is no other way to manually approve or switch another means such as SMS or email… Please fix it ASAP!,2024-03-31 11:20:07,-1
1,Crappy customer service Awful App : It’s just unbelievable to see this app with high rating. Failing to register the PayNow after trying so many times neither on the App or via SMS. Called the customer service she is not efficient not humble also not able to resolve the problem. I will give no star to this extremely poor customer service quality.,2024-02-02 10:13:23,-1
5,Mobile app rubbish : Absolutely in hate of this app and OCBC personal mobile banking. I have not been able to access my account via mobile or laptop for 3 days now. SORT IT OUT NUMPTIES!!,2020-12-08 07:16:00,1
5,Very slow speed of app : Especially when accessing app functions or starting it,2022-03-28 14:52:24,1
1,Can’t open the app after update (16.9) : I reported the issue on 24 dec 2022 Iwas upset as my mobile banking activity was disrupted & worse still online banking using computer also not possible. Such awful experience is totally unacceptable.Can’t open the app after update (17.0)I am still not able to open the App after your latest update (17.0). Very frustrating experience. Please fix my issue as soon as possible.Fyi I once had the similar issue with shopFarEast app and my issue had since been fixed satisfactory. I am very impressed with their competency & they have also proven to me that they are dedicated & reliable.,2022-12-29 02:02:59,-1
5,Convenient to use. : Scan to pay on home page is brilliant!,2021-11-04 03:33:20,1
5,Super thematic : I like how OCBC is always up to date with its festival theme. It is something I look forward to everytime I open the app. Besides that the app is super user friendly.,2021-10-28 01:48:00,1
5,Keeps logging out. : Tried to make a transaction via PayNow but was logged out 2x. Was able to do so only after the 3rd time.,2022-07-06 22:56:20,1
1,Mobile Banking down for 2 days since 01 Dec 2020 : Tried calling the helpline was made to hold for almost an hour. Was told they have problem with mobile banking on iPhone since yesterday and there is no solution yet and the IT Dept is still working on it. No solution for customers which needs to do online banking urgently.. great for OCBC with with IT capability for not solving such major problem after 2 days. Thumbs down,2020-12-02 14:28:51,-1
2,No option to hide account balance : OCBC PayNow app will be decommissioned and we are forced to use the OCBC app. But once I complete the paynow it brings me to the main account balance page where my account balance is showing up in font size 60 for everyone to see. POOR design for PRIVACY. I prefer the original OCBC PayNow app over this a 100% more!,2023-09-25 23:34:07,-1
3,Payment : If the payment amount is changed than it should stay the changed amount. Instead it was brought back the original amount when I input the debiting account,2022-07-28 23:18:22,-1
5,Easy Payment : Find your website is easy to access & make payments,2021-07-25 05:57:54,1
4,Draining hp battery. : The app always make my hp get very hot n it drained my battery really quick… and sometimes it just shuts down my hp when i just start a transaction. But otherwise its easy n convenient to use.,2021-12-04 09:50:33,1
5,User-friendly design : Straight forward design with all the key features easily accessible.,2021-01-12 01:50:37,1
2,Mobile otp : Similar issue to everyone else. When you switch to a new phone. It seems like the app doesn’t work on the new phone. We cannot use one token neither can you log in to the app. The login notification doesn’t appear when you log in therefore you need your old phone to manually generate otp. This bug needs fixing.,2021-02-13 08:13:27,-1
4,terrible : OCBC is bad. My Intermet payment constantly declined each time i need to spend time on phone to fix it and often they say will be fixed within 2h but it is not. I am moving to a Digital bank. OCBC and UOB are obsolete.,2023-06-28 02:24:32,1
1,Stop forcing people to update before use : We are using this to pay on the go and forcing people to frequently update each time is stupid. Imagine having a line of people waiting for you. When it works it’s a serviceable app but frequent updates render wonky slow unresponsive versions. Security updates are fine your CNY graphics is not.,2024-02-20 06:41:47,-1
3,Improve banking functions for more accessible for visually impaired : The “slide to pay” feature is not voiceover friendly. Kindly implement a button for visually impaired to double tap to trigger the paynow function. Please ensure all images & banking functions are voiceover friendly for visually impaired. Thanks!,2023-10-02 10:46:05,-1
2,Credit card : Please add an option to add credit card from other banks. Even when you login to the web version it crashes half the time and you are not sure if you made payment. Worst part is it doesn’t remember my credit card!,2021-05-05 14:23:22,-1
2,This app makes phone heat up : Why does the app makes my phone heat up the second I open it?? It heats up really fast. Sometimes I login to check my balance only (can be done within seconds) and it leaves my phone hot for minutes. I really don’t get it. This is a bank app. Pls get your IT to check and improve?? Cut down on unnecessary stuffs from the app.,2021-01-20 07:07:00,-1
2,Manage deposit e-alerts but can’t even click? : New function to allow users to receive the notification but I can’t even click it to allow? It becomes blank page when I clicked on it? Then what’s the point for this new function??,2023-07-11 08:39:56,-1
1,Even worse after updating app don’t update! : OCBC app became so slow and laggy after updating it! Even after killing app and opening again multiple times still so slow! Then got error message which said undefined and I saw blank spaces in my account page! What you all doing?!!Don’t make us update the app to make it worse!,2023-11-30 13:22:51,-1

5,Blank screen after log in : Blank screen after successfully logged into the apps....???,2021-01-04 07:00:26,1
1,Unable to use online ibanking : Had switched from iPhone 6 Plus recently to iPhone 12 Pro Max. Till today I am not able to login even once using the new phone despite of following the instruction given by OCBC to de-activate the one-touch on my iPhone 6 Plus. This issues was lasting for more than 2 months and seems no solution at all. Please take it seriously to fix the bug for the user.,2021-02-07 10:37:19,-1
5,Why doesn’t support many QR codes : OCBC should really conisodwr accepting more QR codes for scan to pay option…DBS is more accepting for QR codes payment unlike OCBC very dissatisfied experience,2023-11-27 15:27:02,1
1,I don’t want to give one star even : The app is down since three days before and there is no sign of back to life. Basically the app function is linked with online service so no remote operation on any functions everything is dead. Need to let customers know when it could be normal status!!! Cannot believe a bank like OCBC can do things in this way! Regret choose this bank!,2020-12-04 15:36:28,-1
2,Useless app : Always make unnecessary improvements but in fact made end user experience worse. Tried to make payment via axs mobile and link to ocbc app wasted 15mins of my life logging in & out of ocbc 5times or more. End up always have to use dbs app to pay and transfer $$ back to ocbc.,2024-01-03 16:49:57,-1
4,OCBC Banking App Design Doesn’t Make Sense : I executed a transfer of USD in my OCBC global account to SGD in my 360 account. However the exchange rate shown is SGD to USD and not USD to SGD. This doesn’t make sense since when I am transferring USD to SGD I need to know how much SGD I will get when I transfer a certain USD amount.,2022-09-21 10:35:27,1
3,Lagging : this apps it’s so freaking annoying why’s always lagging when I want to paynow or transfer money to someone im in hurry but it’s so freaking slow and keep loading sometimes it can’t be press what’s the hell it’s wrong there’s no update too,2023-12-01 04:00:57,-1
5,First timer : Has always find it risky but now after one try really enjoy banking anywhere. Thank you ocbc,2022-03-24 07:15:06,1
3,Bonus transactions : I have not been able to find the progress of the monthly bonus transactions. It is easy on the desktop but is it available on the app?,2023-09-28 04:44:57,-1
1,Stuck at scanning bottom of ID : Tried to open an account but kept getting stuck at scanning bottom of ID tried to move the card around to minimise glare and better lighting but still can’t get it to scan. Is it better to just allow the user to click and snap the picture themselves?,2023-07-28 12:33:18,-1
2,Not used to it : Every time got to setting need to press left top corner. Those common setting should be available on first page. Not really care abiut “investment” which is available always at bottom… the design of app is not customer centric but how to attract more investment from customer,2023-02-14 13:59:49,-1
1,Slower with new interface : Seems like the entire loading has become so much slower in terms of loading since you upgraded to your new interface. Do have a look  it’s got worst over this weekend and even this morning …hope you all quickly to something about it. Thanks.,2023-01-15 23:04:28,-1
5,Cannot go back to the internet banking screen after opening an estatement(PDF) : No close button...,2021-04-10 08:02:32,1
3,Glitch and bugs! : Can you please fix your bugs & glitch i was in the middle of payment when the app shut down and the next minute i could not even use its QR pay!,2023-11-22 22:47:13,-1
1,Worst OTP implementation : OCBC used to be a pioneer and a leader in ibanking and user friendly banking interface. Since a few months ago it just dwindled into a app with the worst OTP implementation ever. You’d have to open the app and click on one token to get your OTP. It is even more hassle than receiving an sms. I hope ocbc fix this fast before even boomers forsake using your service.,2021-02-11 02:00:20,-1
1,Terrible loading time when accessing the app : The app gets slower after an upgrade. Always take almost 10 secs to even load my account details. Sometimes paynow will stuck and don’t even know if the transaction has gone through. Please work on the response time of the app when a button is click. It’s way too slow and non-responsive.,2020-12-28 13:17:20,-1
1,Cannot login into the OCBC app. : The OCBC app requested me to deactivate my old OCBC app on my previous smartphone. The problem is I how am I supposed to deactivate the app in my previous smartphone when I have reformatted and deleted all of my apps and contents in my previous smartphone. I have no issues on setting up my DBS and UOB apps banking-tokens in my new and current smartphone. Only OCBC app has this issue. Please rectify this troublesome issue in your app OCBC.,2020-12-20 05:33:02,-1
1,FORCED TO ENABLE PUSH NOTIF IN 2024 update : Must enable push notification in order to commence using the app after login page. First time i see a banking app have to force usage of notification no option to reject notification. So must manually go switch it off. Please have better user experience for us by providing the option to reject these at the start.,2024-02-16 12:06:10,-1
1,Fee waiver submission time duration : The holding time duration for hotline call-in submission of fee/ interest waiver is very short and seemingly deliberate—if I don’t have my physical cc with me I’ll need to toggle back and forth with the OCBC app to key in the 16 digits but the manner which the holding time is configured which is short shrift gives the impression that OCBC is dismissive about such submissions. Lousiest impression of such customer service.,2024-01-01 03:08:08,-1
5,Ease and intuitive : Easy to use features are intuitive. Less steps to get to what i need to do. Good experience,2022-06-28 15:20:37,1
1,Lag : App is so slow! The laggiest banking app compared to competitors. Made me relocate my account to other bank with smoother and faster app.OCBC PayAnyone app also worst! App froze at welcome page cannot even do anything! Ended up deleting the app on my phone. I have updated both app to the newest version but apps still lag. With all the money that you have please IMPROVE YOUR APP!,2023-02-09 04:04:54,-1
5,Feedback : Please improve user interface  not so friendly.,2021-08-14 11:46:50,1
5,The new change in user interface is so much better!! : Much cleaner n easier to use. Good upgrade!,2023-01-01 01:15:06,1
1,where is the back button : after i view the e statement where to find the back button? i have to shrink and expand the page and it doesnt work all the time ita reall frustrating to use this app could u just copy dbs app? don’t try to be focus on aesthetics an ugly app with an intuitive UI is better than a sleek looking app with a non intuitve UI the UX is one word FRUSTRATING,2021-06-17 10:30:38,-1
1,One of the worst banking apps : UI is not user-friendly keeps prompting me to update my email address even though I had updated multiple times. There isn’t a way to skip that step or get out of that process. As a result I can’t even do a simple transaction since it keeps asking for me to update my email address.,2024-01-07 09:02:13,-1
1,Pay anyone or Paynow : I can’t seem to use the pay anyone app to transfer funds n it’s been days 31-5 Jan isn’t it a bit too long for system maintenance n they inconvenience that it has brought to user I have to go to an atm to withdraw the cash to transfer to my other bank acct for payment when ur system is not working.,2023-01-05 04:41:02,-1
5,User-friendly : Easy to navigate around the app. User-friendly.,2021-01-12 06:26:57,1
2,Bugs : constantly with the bugs with the app. can’t use because of maintenance all the time some services the app can’t fulfil and you have to do it during 9am-6pm. sometimes some functions are not available. overall a very unstable app it’s getting very annoying.,2022-08-31 14:13:13,-1
5,PANDA Review1 : OCBC Bank App works better with a secured latest iPhone SE device. Sometimes you cannot blame software is hacked or faulty. Have you really secure your hardware on your part.,2022-03-21 20:05:28,1
2,Extremely slow : Not sure if I’m the only one but the app loads really slow when I’m trying to make paynow transactions especially when there’s a queue forming behind me at the shop. Seems this happened after the major app update.,2024-02-26 05:27:52,-1

Learn from DBS please.,2022-02-17 05:33:07,-1

3,Excessive fanciful animations at the startup : It would be great if there’s an option to disable the fanciful transition and animations when opening the app. A much faster startup would definitely benefit the already-fast pace of transactions.,2023-10-08 09:10:57,-1
1,Terrible log-in process : After the latest update I cant even use the app at all anymore. I have activated FaceID multiple times.

What’s the point?!,2023-09-26 10:16:16,-1
1,App very slow and does not show credit cards account : App is very slow since the recent update. The revamp layout is missing some information e.g credit card accounts. Only can see transactions and this does not give a complete picture. Prefer the old layout.,2022-12-30 14:52:01,-1
1,The new transfer UI is really sucked : No sure why recently it comes with the new transfer UI which is a bit messy and not clear comparing with the old transfer UI.

3,Menu bar : Menu is not intuitive for first time users. It takes abit of navigating to find things like one token set up and figure out how to transfer with “fast” as we don’t see the word “fast”. Once set up its okay.,2021-06-12 02:37:24,-1

1,Worst banking app ever : Everything is so unintuitive. Didn’t understand how my card worked at all and ended up incurring hundreds of interest fee over a few months.

1,Cant transfer funds out : It has been a week since i last had this issue. I have been trying to Paynow through UEN to make payment. I am unable to do that since a week ago.

1,Token require for 2nd time authentication : Very lousy n not efficient. In the past using local transfer function can use SMS to authenticate the transaction now changed to token method.

1,Poor app - very frustrating. : have to exit app and re-login multiple times just to view my accounts or do any form of transactions. Very frustrating.

5,Worst banking app among all : After you switch to a new phone the OneToken can’t be activated. Followed all instructions and the help desk can’t help.,2020-12-18 13:07:21,1
5,Transfer to local : Fast and convenient!,2023-06-09 07:42:58,1

Perhaps can learn from DBS. 😄,2023-08-31 09:06:45,-1
3,Sudden change in security policies : Caught by surprise I cannot use the app as oCbc was “ aware” some apps on my phone was not from official play store. I have to manoeuvre differently and that caused me some down time in my business.,2023-08-14 01:42:22,-1
1,Cannot reach the login screen : Even after upgrade to the latest version this lousy app still cannot even reach the login screen. Screen keeps showing blank page once a while show the OCBC logo then blank screen again. The login screen did not appear ?,2021-09-14 12:58:57,-1

2,No last login date & time : There isn’t a function to check my last login date and time. This would allows user to know whether any illegal log in was made. POSB has that which is very useful.,2023-11-15 01:14:25,-1

1,App problem : The security of the app is really an issue. I put a transfer to party A but at confirmation page it showed party B. Redo it 3x (thought I made an error) and same thing happened.

1,Non Digital Mobile App : I have out of access to my account from last 18 hours because of the so called Digital token enabled App. I recommend OCBC should not use advanced features which they can’t handle. Because of the Token mess I am not even access Web App too. Suggest OCBC should revert to Physical token and Web App. Pls decom the Mobile App and token,2020-12-03 02:32:45,-1
1,Scam Warning Screen : Can we not have the scam warning screen every single time we open the app? It’s breaks the flow of using the app especially Paynow.

1,Worst banking app : Slow and hangs continually moving from one request to another.  Using this app is time consuming and wonder why OCBC bothers having a banking app.  It will ruin its reputation.
