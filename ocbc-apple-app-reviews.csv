However upon looking through the reviews, I realised that there are many reviews voicing their frustrations only to have a 5 star rating pinned to it. Perhaps users aren’t familiar with the rating system. Anyway, this app is really unreliable. A common issue being…….app is not able to load at all, and if it did, another issue users might face would be the app being ‘temporarily unavailable’. In the event that users finally manage to enter the app, there will be times where users get logged out almost immediately due to ‘long periods of inactivity’. Truly dysfunctional. Whenever I intend to make a transaction via PayNow, I always check this app in advance as i truly have no idea when there would be errors in logging in (which then affects whether I am able to PayNow). This app has been problematic since forever so i’m really not sure why it hasn’t significantly improved i mean isn’t the loading of the app and the log in something BASIC?

After going through days of trying, 5 customer service personnels, and references of my case to the technical department, I still failed to get the OneToken up and running.

Update: Something I left out. For those who are concerned with privacy, should note what this OCBC banking app does.

2) It wants to know your location when you are NOT using the app.

3) It will scan your wifi network when you are on wifi.

3) I called OCBC customer service, it took sometime for the officer to figure out that “Password can only be changed from internet banking on computer”.
